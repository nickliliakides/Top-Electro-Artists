    "about": "Mihai Popoviciu, from Sibiu in Romania, is considered one of the most innovative eastern European producers of electronic music today. He was born in Romania in 1981 and was drawn to the fast-growing rave scene of the 90’s. He started producing music in 2001 being influenced by the techno and house virus and it took many years of experiments until he came up with his first vinyl release on DJ Hell’s imprint Gigolo Records in 2005. Since then he has steadily added chapters to his personal success story with solo projects and those with partners like Markus Homm or Jay Bliss. In June 2007, his EP 'First Contact' was released on Pascal Feos' label Level Non Zero Recordings. Mihai joined the Highgrade family together with Markus Homm in late 2007 and from then on the duo have had several successful releases on the Berlin based imprint like “Deaf Sniper”, “Lagoon” or “Urban Ballroom”. In 2009 the discographic activity of Mihai got very intense with releases on highly respected European labels such as Fear Of Flying, Hudd Traxx, Bang Bang or Diynamic. The club hit Bis Co (produced together with Markus and Jay Bliss) was featured in all major dance charts across Europe and confirmed once again his fine producing skills. When teaming up with Jay Bliss the duo call themselves Hermannstadt Collective, a DJ and producing team that has made big waves on the dance floors all over the world with tracks like “Raw Fruit”, “Thirst Day” or “Safety Match”. Mr. Popoviciu is the kind of producer that likes to innovate and to always refine his varied sound palette surprising the audience in the best way. It’s not a big surprise that Mihai’s reputation as a DJ grew fast in the past years taking him to Europe’s most important clubs and venues. His DJ sets have a distinctive personal touch delivering you a perfectly balanced mixture of groovy beats, warm pads and musical emotions that will get you addicted.",

    "nationality": "Romania-Germany",
    "about": "When MarKus Homm started going to his first House parties, the likes of Beatport and Myspace hadn’t even been thought of. Born in 1980, Marcus was 15 years old when he became infected with electro music and subse- quently got his hands on a turntable. He then began to seek out the latest releases at the record store and also by asking local DJ’s the identity of the tracks that had kept him dancing late into the night. Markus Homm was born in Romania, and now lives in Nurenberg. Eventually the second turntable made it into the equation and he started to mix records. His first gig came at age 21 and proved to be the first of very many.In 2000 Markus returned to his former homeland. In Romania he played several gigs and met his current production partner and friend Mihai Popoviciu. Impressed by the quickly developing club scene in Romania he opened a record store with fellow local DJ’s in Sibiu. It is not only his passion for techno music that has taken him to places far and wide. Since he was 18 years old, Markus has been traveling as a professional dancer to tournaments all over the world. Learning Latin American dance has definitely influenced his sense of rhythm and his training has taught him the intricate design and implementation of many forms of music. In 2006, Homm’s professional career took him to Moscow, and it was there that he started to produce music. Working sometimes alone and sometimes with partner Mihai Popoviciu, he formulated his own unique style of dance music, ranging from Deep House to Tech House. Markus Homm’s music is in a constant state of development, always searching for, and finding the most compelling groove. This diverse musical direction has led Homm & Popoviciu to successful releases with various labels, including their home label Highgrade Records, and Diynamic Music. In 2009 they had a widely acknowledged summer hit with “Bis Co”. Markus Homm has also released a string of solo tracks and remixes which have gained notable success and positive feedback. Markus Homm has earned himself a solid position in the international Techno scene. Legendary Berlin clubs like Panorama Bar, Watergate and Tre- sor, or international destinations and venues in Zurich, Bucharest, Mexico, Madrid, Tokyo and Hong Kong are his regular playrooms. But despite all the fun of the last few years, Markus Homm has continued to push his musical development. The Highgrade Disharmonic Orchestra is his latest Live project, alongside label colleagues Tom Clark, Todd Bodine, Dale und Daniel Dreier. The group made an amazing debut in the summer of 2010 at Watergate. And soit goes on. Producer and DJ Markus Homm moves consistently forward and continues his playful exploration of the tensions between music and body, while working on his own unique and very special musical success story.",

In 1987 he organized the first acid house party there, and in the same year at Grössenwahn deejayed at Run–D.M.C.’s aftershow party. At the end of the 1980s, he developed his style at various Munich clubs and dance halls from New Wave, EBM, Electro, and Hip hop to include House and Techno.

The experience aquired along the way has switched the scene from the amateur thing of the beginning to the standard of today; an acclaimed production with an exquisite feeling for sounds and percussion. The project Ticon was started in 1999 as a natural progression towards something new and they soon got the attention deserved. Their unique style walks the thin line between trance and psytrance with crossover excursions on both sides. This gives the album a variation from the floorfilling to the hipswinging funky but they all emit the Ticon sound and the message to be happy and to be loosin it to the music.",

    "about": "Ramon was born and raised in Holland, and followed in his father’s footsteps in his teenage years when he began producing. His mother met his father some years after he escaped from Pinochet’s Chile, where his own music had incensed the military government and made him a cultural dissident. Ramon’s youth was thankfully not as turbulent nor dangerous, with the young talent brought up on a musical diet that was incendiary in its own way: Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones, Kraftwerk, Front 242, and the early pioneers of Detroit techno. His two older sisters played a key part in his musical formation, sparking his imagination with tales of dance floor epiphanies upon their return from clubs of the country’s heyday.Once bitten by the techno bug, Ramon moved to Belgium’s scene capital, Antwerp, to study as a jeweler and diamond cutter. It was a part-time job in a record shop that helped to decide his destiny, however. He began producing t racks wit h a colleague, and slowly learned to produce solo. After a fruitful period producing much tougher techno, a resurgent Ramon Tapia began to find fame under his new moniker in the late 2000s on labels like Herzblut, Craft and Yellow Tail, forging a new school techno sound that blended the slower, sexier sounds of the contemporary vibe with his schooling in the genre from the past few decades. In 2010 he mixed a compilation for New York’s legendary Strictly Rhythm, plundering their back catalogue for a full mix of new interpretations by him and various collaborators. This marked the biggest turning point in his career, catapulting him onto the world stage.",

Oliver Huntemann is one of a handful of children of the north who, for what seems like an eternity, add an element of credence to the mythology. He does not, of course, live in a snowy forest or at the edge of the polar oceans. The sun does, on occasion, shine down on Hamburg. Nevertheless, there is a tendency towards hypothermic reduction in the rigorous efficiency of the Huntemann oeuvre. Images of cold storage warehouses, desolate heavy plant sites and bluish flesh are not entirely misplaced. Shards of German Engineering glimmer in his music, laced with persuasive logic, gruesome Darwin- ism. What remains: what works.In “Brighter than the sun“, the English music theorist Kodwo Eshun depicts the birthplace of Kraftwerk, Dusseldorf, as the “Mississippi Delta of Techno“. Huntemann’s tracks may well have dragged themselves out of the same primeval soup, but it was the far north which fired them with the necessary steel for clubland.",

His musical influences are deeply rooted in 70s Funk and Disco sounds that spawned todays House music but also original soundtracks from 50's and 60's cult movies. With such a large mix, Dimitri remains of one of clublands most empathic and most unpredictable DJs. Playing across genres and tempos his first goal is to share his love for music while moving your mind, body and soul.

After the group split the following year,Cook became involved with the burgeoning acid house scene, pairing with producers Tim Jeffrey and J.C. Reid toward the end of the decade to form Pizzaman.",

    "about": "With his unmistakable sound-mix of Jazz- and Swing samples and electronic music, Parov Stelar has secured his own unique position in the world of music. His Productions address club-audiences as well as the home-listener. After his first records-releases using different aliases as well as his real name, Marcus Füreder foundet Etage Noir Recordings in 2003. Since then he releases as Parov Stelar. In 2004 his “KissKiss EP” and soon after released album longplayer “Rough Cuts” meant his breakthrough in the international electroinic music scene. His uncommon approach to music-production combined with an assured sense of sound-aesthetics led to massive respect from his colleagues and the reputation as inventor of a genre (Rainer Trüby once called this genre “Minimal Jazz House”). The follwoing albums “Seven and Storm” and “Shine” as well as numerous singels and remixes made Parov Stelar one of the most reliable ande successful artists of his kind.",
