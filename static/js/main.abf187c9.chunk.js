He was born in Romania in 1981 and was drawn to the fast-growing rave scene of the 90\u2019s. He started producing music in 2001 being influenced by the techno and house virus and it took many years of experiments until he came up with his first vinyl release on DJ Hell\u2019s imprint Gigolo Records in 2005. Since then he has steadily added chapters to his personal success story with solo projects and those with partners like Markus Homm or Jay Bliss. In June 2007, his EP 'First Contact' was released on Pascal Feos' label Level Non Zero Recordings. Mihai joined the Highgrade family together with Markus Homm in late 2007 and from then on the duo have had several successful releases on the Berlin based imprint like \u201cDeaf Sniper\u201d, \u201cLagoon\u201d or \u201cUrban Ballroom\u201d. In 2009 the discographic activity of Mihai got very intense with releases on highly respected European labels such as Fear Of Flying, Hudd Traxx, Bang Bang or Diynamic. The club hit Bis Co (produced together with Markus and Jay Bliss) was featured in all major dance charts across Europe and confirmed once again his fine producing skills.

(DJ MAG 245) Mihalis has built up a massive following with his DJ sets and production work throughout his career and has already started making waves on the nternational techno circuit. He is concidered to be as one of the mostproductive producers in techno. Born in Athens, he started experimenting with music at the age of 12, when he studied the piano. He quickly became interested in electronic music and started using new music technology to create his own tracks. Initiated early into the restless music scene of the end of the 90s, Mihalis\u2019 career started in 1997 when he landed a residency at Berlin Club, one of Greece\u2019s most notorious venues. During that period, he had been mainly mixing house but by the end of the decade, had changed his style to techno and techouse. In 2000 Mihalis started experimenting with the harder side of the dance scene and introduced Greek clubbers to the techno sounds of Detroit\u2019s percussive rhythms. His first major gig was at the well-known SolaLuna Festival, where he was on the bill next to world\u2019s biggest names in techno. This appearance led to countless residencies at all major Greek clubs including Venue, Mad, Danza, Miroir, Luv and many more. Soon he landed the headlining slot at the legendary club, Umatic (Plusmatic) where he built a huge fan base that led to his nomination as best Greek techno DJ in 2005 by Klik Magazine. A significant experience as a DJ provided him with a solid technical background and knowledge that will enrich his future musical production. As a producer, Mihalis Safras is a prolific artist who continues to develop his sound that he describes as 'techno combining the hard and funky edges of the groovy minimal'. Releasing his tunes on 'monster' labels such as Trapez, Great Stuff, Harthouse, Zenit and many other well-known labels. Mihalis reaches international awareness and his tracks appear in the charts of the biggest DJs like Sven Vath, Richie Hawtin, Dubfire, Adam Beyer, Ricardo Villalobos and many more. His astonishing discography, which gained him innumerable appearances in many international DJs showcases and his friendship with the ''UK master'' Mark Broom, lead in 2006 to the birth of his own label Material Series. A smooth label built on the idea of releasing groovy club tunes with material names, all in coloured 12' vinyl. Material Series presents not only Mihalis' ideas on techno but also famous respected artists that included on Material roster. Also in mid of 2007 Material's 'sister' label, Playmobil Series, was born to embrace techno scene's melodic lovers. Currently Mihalis Safras is considered key-roster artist of Traum Schallplatten Labels and he is focused in composing his second personal album (double LP/ CD) that will be released this winter. Also some huge remixes he did for Britney Spears and Ali Dubfire will be released later this year. Traveling around the world (but not Greece after his own decision), Mihalis performs and spreads his tricky brilliant sound and becomes a milestone of the international techno scene. By the end of each day you will find one word in his mouth: 'Am I burned out of music yet?'. Expect much from Mihalis in 2008!

Mainly associated with a driving, percussion-heavy style of techno created entirely with DJs and dance clubs in mind, he is the manager of the appropriately named Drumcode label. He has released a few full-lengths, including 1996's Decoded and 2002's surprisingly eclectic Ignition Key (on his more atmospheric Truesoul label), but his recorded output mainly consists of numerous singles and EPs. Praised for his impeccable, innovative mixing skills (often involving three turntables and fast-paced transitions), he has released several acclaimed mix CDs, including 2002's Stockholm Mix Sessions, Vol. 3 and 2005's Fabric 22, and is constantly booked at major clubs and festivals throughout the world. Beyer was born in Stockholm in 1976. By the time he turned 20, he had already released nearly a crate full of records, either on his own or as part of short-lived trance, acid, and techno projects with fellow Swedish producers like Peter Benisch, Jesper Dahlb\xe4ck, and Joel Mull. Drum Codes 1, his first solo EP for Planet Rhythm Records in 1995, provided the name for his Drumcode label a year later. Planet Rhythm released Beyer's full-length debut, Decoded, as well as its remix companion, 1997's Recoded, but he has mainly focused on Drumcode and its related imprints since then (although he has sporadically recorded for other notable labels, such as Soma, Plus 8, and Wagon Repair). Beyer's second album, Protechtion, appeared on Drumcode in 1999. While best known for his harder, grittier tracks, he began to release slightly softer, more melodious tracks through his Code Red imprint and Conceiled Project alias. In 2002, he founded the Truesoul label and expanded on these deep techno and ambient sounds with his third full-length, Ignition Key, which explored Detroit-influenced techno and electro.",picture:"https://image-ticketfly.imgix.net/00/01/98/07/25-og.jpg?w=500&h=334&fit=crop&crop=top",releases:"https://www.beatport.com/artist/adam-beyer/6824/releases"},{id:4,name:"MARKUS HOMM",genre:"Deep House, Tech House",nationality:"Romania-Germany",about:"When MarKus Homm started going to his first House parties, the likes of Beatport and Myspace hadn\u2019t even been thought of. Born in 1980, Marcus was 15 years old when he became infected with electro music and subse- quently got his hands on a turntable. He then began to seek out the latest releases at the record store and also by asking local DJ\u2019s the identity of the tracks that had kept him dancing late into the night. Markus Homm was born in Romania, and now lives in Nurenberg. Eventually the second turntable made it into the equation and he started to mix records. His first gig came at age 21 and proved to be the first of very many.In 2000 Markus returned to his former homeland. In Romania he played several gigs and met his current production partner and friend Mihai Popoviciu. Impressed by the quickly developing club scene in Romania he opened a record store with fellow local DJ\u2019s in Sibiu. It is not only his passion for techno music that has taken him to places far and wide. Since he was 18 years old, Markus has been traveling as a professional dancer to tournaments all over the world. Learning Latin American dance has definitely influenced his sense of rhythm and his training has taught him the intricate design and implementation of many forms of music. In 2006, Homm\u2019s professional career took him to Moscow, and it was there that he started to produce music. Working sometimes alone and sometimes with partner Mihai Popoviciu, he formulated his own unique style of dance music, ranging from Deep House to Tech House. Markus Homm\u2019s music is in a constant state of development, always searching for, and finding the most compelling groove. This diverse musical direction has led Homm & Popoviciu to successful releases with various labels, including their home label Highgrade Records, and Diynamic Music. In 2009 they had a widely acknowledged summer hit with \u201cBis Co\u201d. Markus Homm has also released a string of solo tracks and remixes which have gained notable success and positive feedback. Markus Homm has earned himself a solid position in the international Techno scene. Legendary Berlin clubs like Panorama Bar, Watergate and Tre- sor, or international destinations and venues in Zurich, Bucharest, Mexico, Madrid, Tokyo and Hong Kong are his regular playrooms. But despite all the fun of the last few years, Markus Homm has continued to push his musical development. The Highgrade Disharmonic Orchestra is his latest Live project, alongside label colleagues Tom Clark, Todd Bodine, Dale und Daniel Dreier. The group made an amazing debut in the summer of 2010 at Watergate. And soit goes on. Producer and DJ Markus Homm moves consistently forward and continues his playful exploration of the tensions between music and body, while working on his own unique and very special musical success story.",picture:"https://www.dachstock.ch/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Markus-Homm.jpg",releases:"https://www.beatport.com/artist/markus-homm/53403/releases"},{id:5,name:"HOT SINCE 82",genre:"Deep House, Tech House",nationality:"United Kingdom",about:"British deep/tech-house DJ and producer Daley Padley has achieved a remarkable amount of success under the name Hot Since 82. His tracks are energetic and a touch dramatic, yet smooth and not over-produced, and are perfectly tailored for clubs and dance festivals. After collecting some of his initial singles and remixes as Hot Since 82 on the 2013 full-length Little Black Book, Padley founded Knee Deep in Sound in 2014 and continued releasing singles and mix CDs on the label, as well as others such as Truesoul and Moon Harbour. Padley was born and raised in Barnsley, England (in 1981, contrary to his moniker). He started frequenting clubs as a teenager, and began spinning at a hometown club at the age of 17, where he became renowned for his 12-hour weekend sets. He began traveling to Ibiza in 2003, and started a residency at Cream Ibiza in 2006. He also started releasing tracks under his own name, but he gradually became tired of the more commercial Ibiza sound, and took a break from spinning and producing music. However, he regained his faith in house music when he resumed clubbing in Leeds in 2010. That summer, he and his friends were attending an Ibiza after-party when the music abruptly stopped. Padley plugged his phone into the sound system and played one of his unfinished tracks, and the crowd responded enthusiastically. 'Let It Ride', Padley's debut single as Hot Since 82, was released by Noir Music in 2011, and was soon followed by the Forty Shorty EP on Get Physical, two Hot Jams EPs on Noir, and several tracks on Moda Black. He also remixed songs by Pete Tong, Rudimental, David Lynch, and Green Velvet, among many others. Padley's star continued to rise in 2013, as his set for BBC's Essential Mix series aired, and his debut full-length, Little Black Book, was released by Moda Black. In 2014, he was featured on the cover of Mixmag, headlined the U.K. festival Creamfields, and launched his own label, Knee Deep in Sound, dedicated to up-and-coming underground house artists. He released a mix CD, also titled Knee Deep in Sound, through the label, as well as singles such as 'Time Out' and the Black Box-sampling 'Somebody Everybody.' A second Essential Mix, recorded live at Ibiza club Space, aired in 2015, and Hot Since 82 mixed the second disc of All Gone Ibiza 2015, a double disc split with Tong. Padley continued playing at clubs and festivals throughout the world, selling out tours of North and South America as well maintaining a long-standing residence at Pacha Ibiza. Among his single releases, 'Damage' was issued by Adam Beyer's Truesoul in 2015, and 'Evolve or Die' appeared on Moon Harbour in 2017, the year he was nominated for Producer of the Year at the inaugural Electronic Music Awards.

That large span of time has undoubtedly affected his choice of records, since Cox routinely detours through breakbeat, Italian house, and the dance mainstream during his usual sets of hard techno. Perhaps the best testament to his mixing skills is his immense popularity despite his focus on music much more intense than the brand of arena trance spawned by Oakenfold, Sasha, Digweed, and others. Cox was born in Manchester in 1962, to parents originally from Barbados (they later moved back after he grew up). Cox began DJing family get-togethers at the age of eight, selecting records from his parents' stack of soul 45s. He was buying his own records soon after, and owned his first pair of turntables at the age of 15. The rest of his teens was spent making spare money at any event he could DJ; though Cox studied electrical engineering in college, he quit after six months and began working various jobs until he could become a full-time DJ. Cox had followed the musical trends from disco to rare groove on to hip-hop during the late '70s and early '80s, but the introduction of house into Britain during the middle part of the decade convinced him that he had found his niche. After moving to Brighton in 1986, his reputation bloomed during the acid house explosion of 1988-1989; Cox played the opening night at Shoom, one of the defining club nights of Britain's house revolution (as well as other legendary hot spots like Land of Oz and Spectrum). In front of 15,000 at the 1989 open-air event Sunrise, he unveiled his use of three decks on the mix; that signature technique built him into one of the top DJs of the late '80s and early '90s. By 1992 Cox had signed an unheard-of long-term production deal with Paul Oakenfold's Perfecto Records and hit number 23 on the British charts with his debut single, 'I Want You (Forever)'. His second single, 'Does It Feel Good to You' also reached the Top 40, and he quickly diversified by setting up his own record label (Worldwide Ultimatum) and an international DJ agency (Ultimate). The onset of a more hardcore rave sound (and the fact that he was increasingly becoming pigeonholed within it) forced Cox to spend several years reestablishing his niche. In a bit of irony, commercial successes like Cox's own steered him away from high-BPM candy-core and toward the still soulful house and techno scene. Three years after his hit singles, Cox returned with the first volume in what became a genre-defining mix compilation series, F.A.C.T.: Future Alliance of Communications and Tecknology. After the first volume dropped in 1995, surprisingly high sales figures earned a second two years later (released in America as well). One year later, Cox released his first studio full-length with 1996's At the End of the Clich\xe9. Mix album The Sound of Ultimate B.A.S.E. followed in 1998, with another studio album, Phuture 2000, appearing in 1999. One year later, he released the self-explanatory Mixed Live, recorded at Chicago's Crobar. A second edition of Mixed Live appeared two years later along with the mix CD Global. The DJ's next busy year was 2004 with the Pure Intec mix CD appearing in August and Cox's entry in the Back to Mine series dropping in November. Second Sign appeared in 2006 with new Cox productions and a diverse set of collaborators, including superstar DJ Norman Cook and Detroit techno pioneer Kevin Saunderson.",picture:"https://dancingastro-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-21-at-2.07.13-PM.png",releases:"https://www.beatport.com/artist/carl-cox/6821/releases"},{id:11,name:"DJ HELL",genre:"Electro, Techno",nationality:"Germany",about:"Helmut Josef Geier aka DJ Hell has worked as a DJ since 1978.

An architect by trade, Boratto is a master of exquisitely crafted sound design, but his tracks are always imbued with warmth and humanity. He broke through with his widely praised 2007 full-length debut, Chromophobia, and remained with Kompakt for several subsequent albums, including the darker III (2011) and Pentagram (2018), while releasing singles on a host of smaller labels. Boratto was born in Sao Paulo, Brazil in 1974. He began contributing to recordings as a producer and multi-instrumentalist during the early '90s. He joined the successful dance-pop band Sect during the middle of the decade, and worked with the disparate likes of Steel Pulse, Gal Costa, Garth Brooks, and others. Boratto began releasing 12 inch EPs and singles in 2005, quickly filling up a DJ crate with records on Circle Music, Plastic City, and various Kompakt sublabels.

Boratto's volume of the Renaissance: The Mix Collection series saw release in 2010. Boratto's third album, III, was released by Kompakt in 2011, and was significantly darker than his past work. Following The K2 Chapter, a digital compilation of his earlier singles for Kompakt's K2 imprint, his fourth album, Abaporu, appeared in 2014, returning to his more cheerful, party-friendly sound.

His mother met his father some years after he escaped from Pinochet\u2019s Chile, where his own music had incensed the military government and made him a cultural dissident. Ramon\u2019s youth was thankfully not as turbulent nor dangerous, with the young talent brought up on a musical diet that was incendiary in its own way: Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones, Kraftwerk, Front 242, and the early pioneers of Detroit techno. His two older sisters played a key part in his musical formation, sparking his imagination with tales of dance floor epiphanies upon their return from clubs of the country\u2019s heyday.Once bitten by the techno bug, Ramon moved to Belgium\u2019s scene capital, Antwerp, to study as a jeweler and diamond cutter. It was a part-time job in a record shop that helped to decide his destiny, however. He began producing t racks wit h a colleague, and slowly learned to produce solo. After a fruitful period producing much tougher techno, a resurgent Ramon Tapia began to find fame under his new moniker in the late 2000s on labels like Herzblut, Craft and Yellow Tail, forging a new school techno sound that blended the slower, sexier sounds of the contemporary vibe with his schooling in the genre from the past few decades. In 2010 he mixed a compilation for New York\u2019s legendary Strictly Rhythm, plundering their back catalogue for a full mix of new interpretations by him and various collaborators.

Nevertheless, there is a tendency towards hypothermic reduction in the rigorous efficiency of the Huntemann oeuvre.

Following The K2 Chapter, a digital compilation of his earlier singles for Kompakt's K2 imprint, his fourth album, Abaporu, appeared in 2014, returning to his more cheerful, party-friendly sound. Boratto founded a label called D.O.C., which released material by artists such as Elekfantz and Shadow Movement, in addition to Boratto's collaborations with the likes of Mixhell (Animal Machine) and Leo Janeiro (MooDisco). In 2018, Kompakt released Boratto's fifth full-length, the ambitious, cinematic Pentagram, which featured collaborations with progressive house innovator BT and vocalist Nathan Berger. The Hastings, England native had been DJ'ing for close to ten years when his demo mixtape caught the ear of Geoff Oakes, promoter of British nightclub Renaissance. He was soon working alongside the likes of another popular Renaissance DJ, Sasha (Alexander Coe). The new position gave the DJ what he needed for his big breakthrough, and he has continued to prosper ever since. In 1994, Sasha & John Digweed's Renaissance: The Mix Collection was released. The continuously mixed three-CD set was intended as a sampler of the types of progressive house and tracks played at Renaissance, and was one of the first heavily promoted DJ mix compilations. The album was a surprise huge-seller, and eventually earned a reputation as one of the best commercially available DJ mixes of all time. The collection's second volume, mixed by Digweed solo, followed in 1995, and soon approached gold status in Europe. Sasha & Digweed continued their collaboration with the Northern Exposure series, named for the club night they were promoting at the time. The first volume was issued as a two-CD set in Europe by Ministry of Sound in 1996. The collection was another success, and an abridged single-disc American edition issued by Ultra Records in 1997 established the duo's popularity stateside, helping to create an American audience for the emerging progressive house sound. The second volume was released as a two-CD set in Europe in 1997, with both discs released individually as East Coast and West Coast editions stateside in 1998. In 2002, Digweed scored Stark Raving Mad, a film about a heist pulled at a rave. During the same year, Sasha & Digweed and Jimmy Van M completed a major American tour called Delta Heavy. Several solo Digweed mix albums followed, including additions to the popular Fabric and Choice: A Collection of Classics series, and two volumes of Layered Sounds. Sasha & Digweed celebrated the tenth anniversary of the original Renaissance mix with an updated version in 2004, re-creating the original mix and taking advantage of the improved technology. In 2006, Digweed began a new mix CD series on Renaissance called Transitions, which was also the name of his Kiss radio show at the time. The series produced four volumes between 2006 and 2008. Also during that time, Sasha & Digweed (who had technically never split up) performed several reunion gigs, culminating in a 2008 North American tour. Digweed continued to release an astonishing number of mix CDs on Bedrock Records, issuing as many as three per year. Two volumes of Structures appeared in 2010 and 2011, and a series of recordings of Digweed's live sets began in 2012. Reflecting his penchant for extremely lengthy DJ sets, most of the series' volumes contained more than two discs, while 2016's Live in Montreal (drawn from an 11-hour set) included six CDs.",picture:"https://cdn.wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/john-digweed.jpg",releases:"https://www.beatport.com/artist/john-digweed/8287/releases"},{id:19,name:"JOEY NEGRO",genre:"Nu Disco, Disco House",nationality:"United Kingdom",about:"Joey Negro integrated his passion for disco music into house music as both a producer and as a remixer, causing many to call his music disco-house. Negro released music under a plethora of monikers for a multitude of record labels throughout the '90s and into the next millennium. Just as importantly, he curated several crucial compilations that gathered underappreciated dance music from the '70s and '80s. Born as Dave Lee on England's Isle of Wight, Negro's lifelong relationship with dance music began in the late '70s when he began collecting disco, soul, and funk records. In 1986 he moved to London and began working at a record store, Smithers & Leigh. The store closed down a year later, however, and Negro began working for Rough Trade Distribution, starting its dance department, Demix, and working with labels like Rhythm King. Negro started his own label in 1988, Republic Records, and released his first production, M.D.EMM's 'Get Busy'. Negro would go on to release most of his early productions on Republic over the next few years. His first release as Joey Negro came in 1991, 'Do It Believe It', released on Nu Groove, followed by Do What You Feel', released on another of his labels, Z Records. Virgin eventually licensed 'Do What You Feel' and the song became both a club hit and a pop hit, resulting in an album deal with the major label. Throughout the remainder of the decade, he continued releasing his productions under an array of monikers and had even more success as a remixer, not to mention his DJing. The compilations of rare disco and post-disco he assembled include Jumpin' (two volumes on Harmless), The Soul of Disco (three volumes on Z), Disco Spectrum (three volumes on BBE), Disco Not Disco (the first two volumes, for Strut), Destination: Boogie (Z), and Backstreet Brit Funk (Z). In 2017, he released Produced with Love (Z), which combined newer disco-rooted material with a selection of past production and remix highlights.",picture:"https://electronicgroove.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Joey-Negro.jpg",releases:"https://www.beatport.com/artist/joey-negro/1113/releases"},{id:20,name:"ROGER SANCHEZ",genre:"House, Garage House",nationality:"USA-Dominican",about:"Just one in the cast of crucial producers who made Strictly Rhythm the premiere American house label during the early '90s, Roger Sanchez grew into a prolific remixer, world-class mainstream DJ, and top global-house name by the end of the decade. Though he concentrated more on mix albums than proper studio productions under his own name, Sanchez gained much respect with club kids as well as the dancefloor intelligentsia. Born in New York to parents of Dominican heritage, Sanchez attended Manhattan's School of Art & Design with several future hip-hop legends including Kurtis Mantronik. He was well into the graffiti and break-dancing scene during the early '80s and began DJing by the age of 13. After mixing for several years at New York hot spots like the Tunnel -- even while he was studying architecture at the Pratt Institute -- Sanchez finally left college in 1987 to give music a full-time shot. His club Ego Trip was soon booming (with Sanchez mixtapes selling briskly on Broadway) and he never looked back. By 1989, Gladys Pizarro from Strictly Rhythm Records had touched base to see if Sanchez was interested in production; one year later, he had recorded his first single, 'Luv Dancin', as Underground Solution. The single's tough underground grooves charged the New York house scene, then just on the cusp of a turnover from the smooth garage sound to a rougher style influenced by European trance and techno. Despite stumbling into remixing by accident -- after giving a bad review to a single, he was tapped to rework it -- Sanchez became more than competent at the game, and beginning in 1991 he worked on tracks for Babyface, Michael Jackson, Diana Ross, Janet Jackson, Chic, M People, Basia, Incognito, and Soul II Soul. Later Sanchez productions -- a 1994 Latin dub-house burner named 'Sumba Lumba' (as Tribal Confusion), the following year's hard-hitting Strictly 4 the Underground EP (as Roger S), and that same year's 'Release Yo Self' (as Transatlantic Soul) -- cemented his status as one of Strictly Rhythm's greatest assets and one of the world's leading mainstream producers. Though his own One Records collapsed in 1995, Sanchez formed another label named Narcotic and signed up with the British club Hard Times to release his first full-length. The mix LP Hard Times: The Album featured the S-Man (with just two decks, a mixer, and a crate of records) proving his worth as a DJ in addition to his much-hyped studio work. He continued in the mix-LP vein, releasing volumes in two high-profile series (Mixmag Live!, United DJ's of America), and the Freeze collection Roger S. Mega Mix. In 1997, Narcotic Records released 'Back' (as S-Men), the fruits of the dance super-group formed by Sanchez, Junior Sanchez, and DJ Sneak. One year later, Sanchez released S-Man Classics, a two-disc collection including his best remixes backed with his best own productions. A few mix albums followed during the next three years, but a full production album, First Contact, finally dropped in 2001. Sanchez launched a new label in 2002 named Stealth -- home to his impressive rate of mixes, as well as re-releases and new productions from himself as well as other artists. The following year, he won a Grammy in the category of Best Remixed Recording for his remix of No Doubt's 'Hella Good', Release Yourself, his long-running terrestrial and online radio show, won an International Dance Music award for Best Podcast. The show celebrated a decade of broadcasts when the mix effort Release Yourself: 10th Anniversary Edition dropped in 2011, the same year that Sanchez joined with the Far East Movement for the single '2gether', The singles 'Troubleman' and 'My Roots' arrived in 2013 along with the mix album Release Yourself 13.",picture:"https://payload.cargocollective.com/1/12/391348/7700455/Skyler-Greene-Photogrpahy_DSC_0820-Edit-Edit.jpg",releases:"https://www.beatport.com/artist/roger-sanchez/4418/releases"},{id:21,name:"DIMITRI FROM PARIS",genre:"House, Nu Disco, Disco House",nationality:"France",about:"As the French Ambassador of stylish club sounds, Dimitri from Paris is everything his nation could be proud of: a DJ, producer, and remixer of the highest standard, and a stylish snake-hipped pin-up with French reserve.

NoW's debut album, A Word of Science, was -- along with early tracks by LFO, Tuff Little Unit, and Tricky Disco -- a crucial bridge between the competing influences of New York house and electro, Detroit techno and soul, London rave and acid, and the burgeoning eclecticism of the years to come. Formed in the late '80s in West Yorkshire as an extension of Evelyn and company's b-boy crew the Soul City Rockers, NoW's first singles, 'Dextrous' and 'Aftermath' were both highly regarded, and the latter shot into the U.K. pop singles Top 40. The subsequent album laid a good deal of the groundwork for the downtempo experimental hip-hop/electro-funk worked over by Mike Paradinas, Luke Vibert, Spacer, and others, and earned the group a secure spot among techno's select crew of next-step innovators. The group nonetheless disbanded following Science's release, with early contributor Kevin Harper leaving to pursue a DJ career and Evelyn turning out a smattering of house tracks on Warp's Nucleus subsidiary before settling into bedroom woodshed mode, often joined by Taylor-Firth. Following a four-year hiatus, Evelyn resurfaced with a track on the Mo' Wax Headz compilation and, soon after, Smoker's Delight, basically an instrumental hip-hop album with a distinctively British eclecticism. Still involved with the same sorts of genre-spanning sampler-and-sequencer experiments, Smoker's Delight was also less obvious, suited more to repeat listenings than previous material. The same was also true for 1999's Carboot Soul, Evelyn's first album as part of a deal with American indie label Matador for domestic distribution. In 2000, NoW produced the first new track by De La Soul in several years, included on an EP -- Sound of N.O.W -- featuring the rap pioneers. Following on its heels was a volume in the Studio !K7 mix series DJ-Kicks. Two years later, Evelyn delivered his fourth LP, Mind Elevation. A bigger gap preceded the release of his next proper LP for Warp, but In a Space Outta Sound finally appeared in 2006, while 2008's Thought So... and the unmixed selector compilation Coming Home followed closely behind. Evelyn continued to work as a downtempo DJ, collaborated with Jazzanova arranger Sebastian Studnitzky, and released Feelin' Good, another eclectic set of productions, in 2013. The following year brought a retrospective set, N.O.W. Is the Time, to celebrate 25 years of activity. Morgan Geist, Optimo's JD Twitch, and Ashley Beedle, among others, granted remixes. Evelyn issued the Ground Floor EP, featuring Andrew Ashong, Wolfgang Haffner, and Acid Mondays, in 2016. The next year, he released the first in a batch of singles that preceded the early-2018 set Shape the Future.",picture:"https://basefm.co.nz/site/wp-content/uploads/wax.jpg",releases:"https://www.beatport.com/artist/nightmares-on-wax/9995/releases"},{id:24,name:"CHEMICAL BROTHERS",genre:"Big Beat, Electronica, Trip Hop",nationality:"United Kingdom",about:"The act with the first arena-sized sound in the electronica movement, the Chemical Brothers united such varying influences as Public Enemy, Cabaret Voltaire, and My Bloody Valentine to create a dance-rock-rap fusion that rivaled the best old-school DJs on their own terms -- keeping a crowd of people on the floor by working through any number of groove-oriented styles featuring unmissable samples, from familiar guitar riffs to vocal tags to various sound effects. And when the duo (Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons) decided to supplement their DJ careers by turning their bedrooms into recording studios, they pioneered a style of music (later termed big beat) remarkable for its lack of energy loss from the dancefloor to the radio. Chemical Brothers albums were less collections of songs and more hourlong journeys, chock-full of deep bomb-studded beats, percussive breakdowns, and effects borrowed from a host of sources. All in all, the duo proved one of the few exceptions to the rule that intelligent dance music could never be bombastic nor truly satisfying to the seasoned rock fan; it's hardly surprising that they were one of the few dance acts to enjoy simultaneous success in the British/American mainstream and in critical quarters. While growing up, both Rowlands and Simons grooved to an eccentric musical diet, ranging from the Smiths and Jesus and Mary Chain to Kraftwerk and Public Enemy. They met while taking the same history course at Manchester University, though neither was a native Mancunian -- Rowlands enrolled because of the legendary Ha\xe7ienda nightclub nearby, while Simons acknowledged the city as birthplace to the Smiths and New Order. The pair began sampling Madchester's vibrant nightclub scene together during 1989 and 1990, just at the peak of Britain's fascination with a DJ'ing style named Balearic. Pioneered at the island hot spot of Ibiza during the mid-'80s, Balearic relied on a blend of early house music, Italian disco, rare-groove jazz and funk, Northern soul, hip-hop, and alternative dance. Original Balearic DJs like Trevor Fung, Paul Oakenfold, and Mike Pickering brought the sound back to indie clubs in London and Manchester, and the style proved very attractive to musical eclectics like Rowlands and Simons. Though Rowlands was already performing in the alternative dance group Ariel, the pair began DJ'ing together at the Manchester club Naked Under Leather in 1991. Hardly believing that their weekend project would progress, they took the semi-serious handle Dust Brothers (a tribute to the American production team responsible for one of their favorite albums, the Beastie Boys' Paul's Boutique). Despite their doubts, Rowlands and Simons' club night did grow more popular, thanks to the duo's Balearic mix of rare house tracks flavored with hip-hop breakdowns, independent-dance fusions, and ancient secondhand discards. After deciding to try re-creating their unique sound in their tiny bedroom studio, the Dust Brothers emerged with 'Song to the Siren', an intriguing example of the new alternative dance scene including sample victims Meat Beat Manifesto and This Mortal Coil. When lawyers for the original Dust Brothers came calling in 1995, though, Rowlands and Simons were forced to change their name to the Chemical Brothers (the proposed Dust Brothers U.K. was turned down). Word on the street and nightclub scene was so good that it hardly mattered; their new residency at the Heavenly Sunday Social quickly became one of the hottest club nights in England -- documented on the mix disc Live at the Social, Vol. 1 -- and their debut album, Exit Planet Dust, was heavily praised by critics. Another fan of the record, Oasis frontman Noel Gallagher, agreed to lend his vocals to a future single named 'Setting Sun', the Chemicals' tribute to one of their own favorites, the Beatles' 'Tomorrow Never Knows'. The single went to number one in late 1996, and the Chemical Brothers opened up for the giant Oasis concert at Knebworth besides headlining their own shows all over the world. The Chemical Brothers' second album, Dig Your Own Hole, took charge of the top spot on the album charts upon its release in April 1997, and on the wings of America's growing electronica push, the album sailed to number 14 stateside and went gold. The duo released a mix album in 1998, Brothers Gonna Work It Out, and followed with their third studio LP, Surrender, in 1999. Rather lackluster expectations sparked a return to the underground with the white-label-only single 'It Began in Afrika' and the duo's fourth album, Come with Us. It too failed to earn the high notices of the first two albums, although after another three-year gap Rowlands and Simons returned with another, 2005's Push the Button, with guest vocalists Q-Tip, Tim Burgess, Kele Okereke, and the Magic Numbers. The music celebrity parade continued on 2007's We Are the Night, this time including the Klaxons, Willy Mason, Fatlip, and Midlake. In 2010 they released Further, their first album with no vocal collaborations, and in 2011 they released Hanna, their first film soundtrack. Sticking with film, in early 2012 they released to select cinemas Don't Think, a combination of a Chemical Brothers live show and a visual document from their longtime art director Adam Smith. The film and live show were made available for purchase in March 2012. Another film contribution followed in 2014, when the Chemical Brothers collaborated with Miguel and Lorde for a song on the Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Pt. 1 soundtrack. With 2015 came the first Chemical Brothers full-length in five years, Born in the Echoes, which featured guest appearances from Beck, St. Vincent, Cate Le Bon, and the returning Q-Tip. It debuted at number one in the U.K. and became the group's sixth chart-topping album.",picture:"https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ChemicalBrothers.jpg",releases:"https://www.beatport.com/artist/the-chemical-brothers/53398/releases"},{id:25,name:"FATBOY SLIM",genre:"Big Beat, Electronica, Acid House",nationality:"United Kingdom",about:"Norman 'Jack-of-All-Genres' Cook, in addition to his former occupations as bassist for the Housemartins and one-third of acid house hit makers Pizzaman, is also the man behind one of the most popular of the new flock of English 'Brit-hop' producers, Fatboy Slim. Releasing his Fatboy material through club staple Skint, Cook's raucous blend of house, acid, funk, hip- hop, electro, and techno has added to his already formidable reputation as one of the foremost all- around producers on the U.K. club scene.Born Quentin Cook in Bromley on July 31, 1963, Cook joined the Hull-based pop group the Housemartins in 1986, replacing founding member Ted Key. After the group split the following year,Cook became involved with the burgeoning acid house scene, pairing with producers Tim Jeffrey and J.C. Reid toward the end of the decade to form Pizzaman. He shut most of his other production activities down in the following years to focus on his solo project as Fatboy Slim, which began with a trio of singles and the full-length Better Living Through Chemistry. Cook was also called in to add his remixing skills to Jean-Jacques Perrey's proto-electronica classic 'Eva', released as a 12inch and CD single in 1997. In addition to his FBS work, Cook also recorded the Skip to My Loops sample CD, a popular studio tool sporting a m\xe9lange of sample-ready drum loops, analog squelches, and assorted noises. In early 1998, his remix of Cornershop's 'Brimful of Asha' spent several weeks at number one in the British charts. Fatboy Slim's eagerly anticipated second LP, You've Come a Long Way, Baby, followed later that year. The album went platinum in the U.S. and spawned two international hits, 'The Rockafeller Skank' and 'Praise You', which also boasted a Spike Jonze-directed video that earned three MTV Video Music Awards as well as two Grammy nominations. Cook also recorded several mix albums, including the first disc of the Radio 1 compilation Essential Selection, Vol. 1 and his own On the Floor at the Boutique. The latter was released domestically in the U.S. in early 2000 to help fans withstand the wait for his third album, Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars, which arrived that fall. Two mix albums -- Live on Brighton Beach and Big Beach Boutique II -- appeared in 2002. During 2003, Cook and his wife -- popular British TV presenter Z\xf6e Ball -- separated for a brief period. They soon patched things up but the split was a heavy influence on 2004's Palookaville, the most laid-back and moody Fatboy Slim album yet. Collecting his singles along with a couple of important remixes, The Greatest Hits: Why Try Harder appeared in 2006. In 2008, Cook announced he would be retiring the Fatboy Slim name and launching a new project, Brighton Port Authority (or BPA for short), a musical concept group featuring special guest artists such as David Byrne, Iggy Pop, Dizzee Rascal, Martha Wainwright, and many more. BPA released the single 'Toe Jam' in 2008. The following year, the Fatboy Slim brand continued to pop up, such as on the mix CD Dance Bitch. Meanwhile, under the BPA moniker, Cook released I Think We're Gonna Need a Bigger Boat. His next project, released in 2010 as Fatboy Slim, involved production work, collaboration, and co-billing with Byrne on the Imelda Marcos concept release Here Lies Love. In 2011, he continued to tour across the globe, and in 2012 he was asked to perform at the London Olympics closing ceremony.

Starting out in the late '80s as a club DJ, the former Alexander Coe got his first big break when he was hired by the dance club Shelly's to spin and rework popular sounds of the day. It was there that the young DJ found fame with the dance and house crowd, but it wasn't until he started laying down his grooves at the Ha\xe7ienda and Renaissance that he become known nationally and, eventually, globally. It was while still at Renaissance that Sasha met another DJ, John Digweed. The two became a remixing team and soon released the first volume of Northern Exposure, a series of mix albums that also functioned as a collection of the duo's remixes for other producers. The duo toured behind the release, visiting the U.S., Australia, South Africa, and Southeast Asia. Sasha refused to limit himself to DJ work, however; he collaborated with singer Maria Naylor on the Top 20 U.K. pop hit 'Be as One', and remixed tracks from such popular artists as the Pet Shop Boys, Simply Red, and M People. He also formed his own record company, Excession Recordings, and wrote originals for Deconstruction. In late 1997, another Sasha + John Digweed compilation appeared, Northern Exposure, Vol. 2, available in both East Coast and West Coast versions (each contained completely different songs). He released several mix albums on his own, as well, including multiple volumes in the Global Underground series (San Francisco and Ibiza). A rare production release, the Xpander EP, became a dancefloor hit in 1999. The mix album Communicate followed a year later, and in 2002, he scored an American record deal with Kinetic and released his first production full-length, Airdrawndagger. His next major record project, Involver, was a fusion of mix album and production record, consisting of his own exclusive remixes of tracks from UNKLE and Ulrich Schnauss, among others. Another inclusion, Felix da Housecat's 'Watching Cars Go By', was nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical. Subsequent volumes Invol2ver and Invol<3r were issued in 2008 and 2013.

By the following decade, he had become one of the best all-around DJs in the world, able to span classic deep house and Detroit techno, the harder side of acid/trance, and surprisingly jazzy tracks as well. He added production work to his schedule in the early '90s, and recorded several brilliant LPs across two additional decades that displayed a similar penchant for diversity. One of the first Europeans to begin mixing American house music in Britain, Garnier was one of the prime cogs in the late-'80s Madchester scene. His DJing at Manchester's legendary Ha\xe7ienda Club provided a major inspiration for the Stone Roses and Happy Mondays to begin adding house rhythms to rock music. Garnier shifted his attention back to France in the early '90s, running the Wake Up Club in Paris for three years and gradually moving into recording as well. For the FNAC label, Garnier released 'French Connection' and the Bout de Souffle EP; after the label went under, though, he formed the F Communications label with Eric Morand (a friend who had also worked for FNAC). He had amassed quite a discography by the mid-'90s, but his first LP, Shot in the Dark, wasn't launched until 1995. His second, 30, appeared in 1997, followed by the retrospective Early Works. After trotting the globe with multiple DJ appearances during the late '90s, Garnier returned to the production realm in 2000 with Unreasonable Behaviour, which was followed by the 2005 set Cloud Making Machine. Retrospective: 1994-2006 combined major singles like 'Crispy Bacon' and 'The Man with the Red Face' with standout remixes for the likes of Alex Attias and Carl Craig. Live recording Public Outburst, issued in 2007 and inspired by improvisational jazz, featured material Garnier wrote and performed with Bugge Wesseltoft, Benjamin Rippert, and Philippe Nadaud. A couple years later, Garnier offered the expansive -- even by his standard -- Tales of a Kleptomaniac. Throughout the decade, he also put together a handful of varied mix albums: Excess Luggage, Life: Styles, and The Kings of Techno, the last of which was a two-disc set shared with comrade Craig. The 2010s were slightly less active for Garnier only when it came to traditional studio content. DJing, broadcasting, and operating F Communications kept him occupied, as did making music for dance productions, television, and film. The year 2015 brought La Home Box, a helpful compilation that rounded up then-recent tracks issued on 12inch and as digital downloads for an assortment of labels, including Hypercolour, 50 Weapons, and Still Music, as well as some exclusive tracks.",picture:"http://res.cloudinary.com/techno/image/upload/h_514,w_770/v1508870362/garnier_electrochoc_b3qzvu.jpg",releases:"https://www.beatport.com/artist/laurent-garnier/8501/releases"},{id:31,name:"KRAAK & SMAACK",genre:"Nu Funk, Nu Disco, Breaks",nationality:"Netherland",about:"One of the more popular acts affiliated with the British label Jalapeno Records, Dutch breakbeat trio Kraak & Smaak enjoyed lots of BBC Radio 1 airplay and also drew large crowds for their live performances, including festival appearances at Glastonbury, Coachella, Miami Winter Music Conference, and South by Southwest. Comprised of Oscar de Jong, Mark Kneppers, and Wim Plug, the trio expands when on-stage, adding Rose Spearman (vocals) and Marc Baronner (bass guitar), and when DJing rather than performing as a live band, they're joined by DJ Sargon. Based in Leiden, the Netherlands, Kraak & Smaak made their recording debut in 2003 on Jalapeno Records with the Money in the Bag EP, the title track of which was championed by Annie Nightingale on her Radio 1 show. A series of additional EPs followed on Jalapeno Records (Keep on Searching, 2004; Set Fire to Disco, 2004; Say Yeah, 2005; Money in the Bag Remixes, 2005; One of These Days, 2005) before the eventual release of the full-length Kraak & Smaak album debut, Boogie Angst (2005), which compiled all of the previously released singles alongside new material, including the forthcoming singles 'Keep Me Home' and 'No Sun in the Sky', Meanwhile, Kraak & Smaak began establishing themselves as a live act and toured the DJ circuit as well; plus, they began doing remix work, the highlights of which would be compiled on The Remix Sessions (2007). In 2008 the trio returned with a new round of studio recordings, first releasing the That's Our Word EP -- highlighted by 'That's My Word', a song featuring Stones Throw affiliate vocalists Dudley Perkins and Georgia Ann Muldrow -- followed by the full-length album Plastic People.

By 1993 Carola had put together his own studio and was issuing tracks for several different labels until he launched his own record company, Design Music, in 1996 (one of the first Italy-based techno-based labels). Ensuing tours of Australia, Europe, and America soon followed, resulting in such releases as 1998's Fokus and 2001's Open Systems, the latter of which Carola describes as an 'electronic experience'.",picture:"http://www.6am-group.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MC.jpg",releases:"https://www.beatport.com/artist/marco-carola/10141/releases"},{id:33,name:"RICHIE HAWTIN",genre:"Techno, Minimal Techno",nationality:"Canada-UK",about:"Although of English and Canadian origins, Plastikman's Richie Hawtin is closely connected with the Detroit techno scene associated with figures such as Kenny Larkin, Stacey Pullen, Eddie Fowlkes, and Derrick May. His Plus 8 label -- co-owned and operated with John Acquaviva -- is one of the most influential experimental dance music imprints, and Hawtin's own tracks recorded as Plastikman and F.U.S.E. are highly regarded as faithful, intelligent, forward-stepping updates of the Detroit sound. A DJ of renown and growing in repute as a remixer, Hawtin has seen his visibility as one of experimental dance music's more important and innovative figures rise ever since the release of his debut Plastikman album, Sheet One. Hawtin was born in Oxfordshire, England, in the early '70s, and when he was nine moved with his parents to Windsor, Ontario, Canada. An early interest in electronic-based pop and dance music turned serious when Hawtin discovered the tracks being pumped out of his neighbor across the river, Detroit. Beginning as a DJ in 1987, Hawtin quickly became involved in composition through his direct involvement in Detroit's tight-knit community of musicians and producers. Combining early influences from European synth pop groups like Kraftwerk and New Order with the stripped-down techno futurism of Detroit innovators such as Juan Atkins and Derrick May, Hawtin's tracks are as steeped in Motor City tradition as they deviate from it in terms of texture and rhythmic complexity. Although 12inch releases issued through Plus 8 and the European NovaMute label have all been pretty dancefloor-oriented, Hawtin's attention to techno-based listening music has been just as focused through his full-length albums. His ambitious series of mix albums -- including 1995's MixMag Live!, 1999's Decks, EFX & 909, 2001's DE9: Closer to the Edit, and 2005's DE9: Transitions -- has emboldened his reputation as a conceptualist DJ.",picture:"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cb0a09dcf79a9f5f785dc709e4a2ce20-650-80.jpg",releases:"https://www.beatport.com/artist/richie-hawtin/3618/releases"},{id:34,name:"NICK WARREN",genre:"Progressive House, Progressive Trance",nationality:"UK",about:"Nick Warren became one of the first so-called 'superstar DJs' in the mid- to late '90s, holding down a high-profile residency at Cream in England, touring around the world, and appearing on several DJ mix albums before they became commonplace. Though he spun an eclectic array of dance styles in the late '80s and early '90s, he eventually championed the late-'90s trance sound of labels like Hooj Choons and joined the ranks of other superstar DJs like Paul Oakenfold, Sasha, and Tall Paul. Furthermore, he dabbled a bit in production, collaborating with Jody Wisternoff as Way Out West. Before leading a jet-set lifestyle, Warren moved to Bristol in the 1980s after having just turned 20. By the early '90s, he was one of the city's top DJs, spinning upstairs at Vision, one of the city's first superclubs. At the time, Warren spun everything from dub and hip-hop to house, which became his preferred style. When fellow Bristol artists Massive Attack left to tour America in the wake of their early success, they invited Warren to accompany them on tour as their official DJ, a testament to his turntable skills as well as his reputation at the time. Eventually, Warren began a massively successful stint as the resident DJ at Cream in Liverpool. The club's stature grew quickly, as did Warren's as a result. Mixmag asked him to mix a volume in its Mixmag Live! series, which the magazine tagged as the 'Future Sound of Europe'. Around this same time, the mid- to late '90s, Warren was also garnering quite a bit of attention for his Way Out West collaboration with Wisternoff, resulting in several popular singles for Deconstruction, most notably 'The Gift', as well as a self-titled full-length featuring the group's hits. Next came an opportunity to mix the third volume in the then relatively obscure Global Underground series of DJ mix albums. The resulting mix, Global Underground: Prague (1997), featured several anthems of the time such as 'Cafe del Mar', 'Life on Mars' and 'Nipple Fish' helping to define the evolving trance sound of the late '90s. Warren's mix proved so successful that he was offered the opportunity to mix a second volume, Global Underground: Brazil (1998), and then yet more successive volumes in the increasingly popular series. Moreover, DMC offered Warren the chance to mix the first volume in its Back to Mine series of downtempo albums. In particular, 2001 was a big year for Warren; the New York-based Mixer magazine chose his Renaissance: Revelation mix album on Ultra Records (also featuring Danny Howells) as its album of the year, and his second Way Out West album, Intensify, also proved to be a favorite among not only listeners but critics as well. Further Global Underground volumes followed in 2003 (Global Underground: Reykjavik), 2005 (Global Underground: Shanghai), and 2007 (Global Underground: Paris).",picture:"https://djmag.com/sites/default/files/styles/djmag_landscape/public/top100/djs/image/nick-warren.jpg?itok=6HfeTQVC",releases:"https://www.beatport.com/artist/nick-warren/17572/releases"},{id:35,name:"SOLOMUN",genre:"Progressive House, Deep House",nationality:"Germany-Bosnia",about:"Solomun has played a major role in redefining European House Music, with productions, remixes and stand-out DJ sets that take the very building blocks of House and sensitively reconstruct them: adding a fresh, ultramodern twist to the genre.

During 1987-1988, Oakenfold hosted a series of crucial club nights that introduced thousands of Brits to house music. Just a few years later, he helped push the new dance crossover into the charts by masterminding hit productions by Happy Mondays (among others) and forming one of the most successful dance labels of the 1990s, Perfecto Records. Even well over a decade after his emergence, Oakenfold remained, quite simply, dance music's most popular DJ. Born in London in 1963, Oakenfold began mixing at the age of 16, and hooked up with friend Trevor Fung to play soul and rare groove at a basement bar in Covent Garden. He also spent some time in New York during the late '70s, working for Arista Records and soaking up the disco scene through Larry Levan's genre-spanning sets at the Paradise Garage. Back in England by the early '80s, Oakenfold worked as a club promoter and British agent for the Beastie Boys and Run-D.M.C. He continued DJing as well, and eventually ended up at the Project, one of the first venues for house music in England, in 1985-1986. With Fung and another friend named Ian St. Paul, Oakenfold was introduced to the exploding club scene on the vacation island of Ibiza (near the coast of Spain) during 1987 and imported the crucial mix of house, soul, Italian disco, and alternative music later dubbed the Balearic style. During 1988-1989, house music and the Balearic style gestated at several Oakenfold-run club nights (Future at the Sound Shaft, then Spectrum and Land of Oz at Heaven) before emerging above terra firma as a distinctly British entity. Oakenfold and Steve Osborne had been working with new dance converts Happy Mondays, and their production for the 1989 Happy Mondays single '(W.F.L.) Wrote for Luck' was voted Dance Record of the Year by NME. The duo's production for the Happy Mondays' breakout full-length, Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches, placed them squarely in the vaunted territory of other new dance producers like Andrew Weatherall (who achieved similar success with Primal Scream's Screamadelica from the same year). Soon, major labels were lining up to have Oakenfold and Osborne remix their biggest pop stars, including U2, Simply Red, New Order, the Cure, Massive Attack, M People, Arrested Development, the Shamen, the Stone Roses, and even Snoop Doggy Dogg (some as Perfecto, the combination remix service and RCA-connected record label founded by the pair in 1990). The Oakenfold/Osborne team were nominated by BPI as Best Producers from 1990 to 1993. By the mid-'90s, dance music had reached the mainstream of British radio and culture, with Oakenfold at the front of a new wave of globetrotting DJs; he toured with U2 and supported live gigs by INXS, the Orb, Simply Red, Boy George, and Primal Scream. On Britain's ever-growing club circuit, he inaugurated the London superclub Ministry of Sound early in the 1990s and became a resident at Britain's other superclub, Liverpool's Cream, instead of taking big money for independent gigs. He also cut down his remix schedule to less than five per year, concentrating instead on the release of a half-dozen mix albums, including several volumes in the Journeys by DJ series. Oakenfold left Cream in 1999, after which Virgin commemorated the occasion with the release of Resident: Two Years of Oakenfold at Cream. Perfecto Presents Another World arrived the following year. A monumental U.S. tour and the fresh Voyage into Trance appeared in early 2000, as did Swordfish: The Album, a soundtrack Oakenfold constructed for the sci-fi film of the same name. In 2002, Bunkka became his first album of new productions. Mix albums like Creamfields (2004) and Perfecto Presents...The Club (2005) appeared before his second production effort, A Lively Mind, landed in 2006. Perfecto: Vegas would arrive in 2009, the same year Oakenfold produced the new title cut to Madonna's hit collection Celebration. In 2011, he announced a new project titled Pop Killer, which was set to feature guest artists like Cee Lo Green and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. However, years passed and he continued to churn out compilation mixes like the We Are Planet Perfecto series and his third LP, 2014's Trance Mission. Talk of Pop Killer resurfaced in 2016 with the release of the single 'U Are' which featured Amba Shepherd and BRKLYN, but the album still did not surface.

But above all that, he has an incredible knowledge and love for music. Since the inception of his career he's had that passion that sets him apart from others. Over the last decade and a half few individuals could claim the type behind-the-scenes influence on American dance culture as Jimmy Van M. His tireless efforts can be credited with having helped advance electronic dance music throughout the North America, opening avenues for artistic expression in dance-clubs that did not previously exist before him and his very unique efforts. Musically, he is hard to categorize as he is as comfortable with downtempo as he is with house and techno. On all of the projects he's taken on he's explored new sounds and styles, always looking for the next best thing. His strength as a DJ comes from the many years he's had behind the decks. Since 1992 he's invented his own vision and his own way of manipulating and delivering what crowds want at any time of the night, morning, or afternoon. His seamless, yet effortless style has cemented him as one of the best DJ's for starting the night off, which many will say about his days as a Twilo resident. It was here that Jimmy teamed up with Sasha and John Digweed to bring a new style of clubbing to the masses. A night of adventure became years of fun, which in turn became a tour. Delta Heavy was the first and only rockstar DJ Tour to take place in America with Jimmy as the warm-up. He eased everything into place perfectly, setting the mood with his finesse and finest tunes. As brilliant of a warm up DJ as he is, he still knows how to deliver peaktime slots in the biggest clubs around the world. His control and patience can be felt on the dancefloor as he brings the energy to a new place with each new record. He knows how to push and pull in all the right directions to send your body and mind into frenzy and back. Jimmy has also established himself as a gifted producer in the studio. Creating sounds with collaborators and friends that finds itself in the vast and varied range of house music. As with the music he picks, the music he makes carries a complexity, sparkle and beauty in it. The time and effort he puts in to deliver the newest and most innovative projects best he can, takes the sort of creative originality that only Jimmy Van M possesses. When it comes to atmosphere, vibe and drive there are very few DJs that can stand alongside Jimmy Van M. Whether it\u2019s putting together a cross-country tour, programming innovative and forward thinking dance music or DJing to thunderous masses anywhere from Buenos Aires to Tokyo he is one of the most characteristic performers to be found anywhere. The Northern Exposure American Tour 1996, Twilo resident 1996-2000 and Delta Heavy 2001 is to name just a few of the residency or tour events that he has participated in as an artist... Global Gathering 2004, the 25,000 person NYE Millennium in Melbourne, Australia, the first ever Creamfields Russia as well as Creamfields Buenos Aires with 55,000 people in attendance would make up the short-list of some of the most important one-off performance events to ever happen globally within electronic dance music that he has also performed in. But this tells only part of the story. It was Jimmy\u2019s formative years at his house in Orlando, Florida where things really fell together for him as a DJ. To list all of the artists who played at his house in those early years would be to index the most famous and notorious dj\u2019s globally, as well as hordes of friends that just came by with a bag of new records. For years and years the only residency that interested Jimmy, or most any other dj on any given Sunday, was his home address. These after-parties still get mentioned and name-checked by most anybody that happened to come through town on a whirlwind tour of his cul-de-sac. It was here that Jimmy really developed his very patterned style of playing, layering endlessly characteristic and suggestive tracks for anybody that happened to stop by. These unending Sundays resulted in one of the most artful and layered mixing styles to be found anywhere. From those humble beginnings he took that playing style and his taste for ever-changing and advanced styles of dance music from that notorious little neighborhood to the far reaches of the globe Jimmy Van M has built a reputation on being among the most patient and sophisticated DJs to be found globally\u2026from his opening sets to his peak-time club sessions and all the way through to the after-hours parties that he\u2019s become so famous for. His ability to deliver music ranging from the deepest of early morning sessions to the most banging and driving peak-hour main-room affairs has placed him in seemingly unlimited and ever-delightful company throughout the world. It remains as one of the most distinguishing features of this very urbane and global performer that, for him, the music must move and then move on.",picture:"https://www.residentadvisor.net/images/profiles/jimmyvanm.jpg",releases:"https://www.beatport.com/artist/jimmy-van-m/11547/releases"},{id:39,name:"SVEN VATH",genre:"Progressive House, Progressive Trance, Techno",nationality:"Germany",about:"Through his recordings, epic-length DJ sets, dozens of commercial mix albums, and label operations, Sven V\xe4th is one German trance and techno's most popular proponents. Originally the lead singer of a dance-pop group named OFF (which included future members of Snap!), V\xe4th hit the big time in 1986 when OFF's 'Electrica Salsa (Baba Baba)' became a number three pop hit in their native country. The band later disintegrated, leaving V\xe4th free to pursue his interest in the hard trance underground of Frankfurt. V\xe4th became a DJ of note for his marathon sets, which sometimes approached 24 hours, and his 1992 co-founding of Harthouse Records. His own releases on the label included those by Barbarella, Astral Pilot, and Metal Masters with the help of his partner, Ralf Hildenbeutel. Blessed with an agreement connecting Harthouse and its subsidiaries to the American major label Warner Bros., V\xe4th released Accident in Paradise, again with contributions from Hildenbeutel, as his first solo album in 1992. A solid debut, it illustrated V\xe4th's concern with connecting techno and trance to the concept-album ideas of prog rock. It died a quick death on American shores, but Mixmag listed it years later in a feature on the best dance albums of all time. V\xe4th's second album, The Harlequin, the Robot and the Ballet Dancer, was released in Europe in 1994, but its American release was delayed more than a year and sank much quicker than its predecessor. After recording an album with Stevie B-Zet as Astral Pilot, V\xe4th laid low for several years, severing his connections with Harthouse and preferring to concentrate on DJ'ing instead. He returned with a contract to Virgin, which resulted in three proper production albums: 1998's Fusion, 2000's Contact, and 2002's Fire. During this period, he started a series of annual mixes with The Sound of the First Season. It was released on Cocoon, a label he named after parties he had started holding the prior decade. Prominent and long-running, Cocoon went on to release a wide variety of 12inch material by the likes of Legowelt and Roman Fl\xfcgel, as well as additional DJ mixes from Steve Bug and Ricardo Villalobos, among others. V\xe4th's own production output was scant, though his hands remained full with his label and a busy schedule he maintained as a revered veteran DJ. The compilation Sound of the 18th Season arrived in late 2017.",picture:"http://stoneyroads.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Sven-Vath-by-Press-Cocoon-900x600.png",releases:"https://www.beatport.com/artist/sven-vath/8624/releases"},{id:40,name:"CHRIS LIEBING",genre:"Techno",nationality:"Germany",about:"Known for his prominence on Frankfurt's dance music scene since the early '90s and for creating eclectic and atmospheric compositions, Chris Liebing is a German techno producer and DJ. He was known for his collaborative work with other producers as well as his own raucous and eerie techno, delivered on albums such as Evolution and Collabs 3000: Metalism. He landed his first DJ residency at the Red Brick club in the town of Giessen in 1991. After the club closed in 1995, he went on to work for Eye-Q Records, where he became friends with Andre Walter, and the pair soon got to work building their own recording studio to record their own material. Throughout the '90s, Liebing released productions for a number of labels -- Clau, Molecular, Primate -- and in 1996 also launched his own imprint, Fine Audio Recordings, which he used to put out a number of singles and EPs, most notably 1997's Dandu Groove and 1998's Drumcook. In 1999 he went on to launch CLR, which saw the release of his first full-length, the philosophy-heavy Evolution, which also featured Walter on production. He promoted the material through sporadic DJ spots around Europe while working on further material. Liebing won the trophy for Best National DJ at the German Dance Awards in 2003. Two years later, he worked with Speedy J on Collabs 3000: Metalism, which was released on Novamute. A period of inactivity followed while Liebing focused on DJ'ing as opposed to production. In 2009 he launched his own podcast, also titled CLR, which saw Liebing present a number of his own mixes as well as guest mixes from the likes of Drumcell, Tommy Four Seven, and Martin Gore of Depeche Mode. Liebing kept busy with the podcast and DJ'ing internationally for almost a decade before returning in 2018 with his third album, Burn Slow, released via Mute Records.

Starting with the Grammy-nominated 2007 single 'D.A.N.C.E.' and that year's full-length \u2020 (aka Cross), the Parisian duo defined the brash, stylish, yet tongue-in-cheek appeal of their label, Ed Banger Records, in the mid- to late 2000s. From there, their music only grew bolder and more unexpected: they cranked up the riffs on 2011's Audio, Video, Disco, and collaborated with the London Contemporary Orchestra on 2016's Woman. With every release, Justice exemplifies the genre-mashing possibilities of a world where all music is available to hear -- and recombine -- in an instant. Justice's Gaspard Aug\xe9 and Xavier de Rosnay began making music in the early 2000s, and first appeared on Musclorvision's Hits Up to You!, a 2003 compilation of songs intended to sound like Eurovision song contest entries. That year, Justice also remixed Simian's 'Never Be Alone' for a college radio song contest; Ed Banger signed the duo and released the single, which eventually became popular in England and Germany as well as France. In 2005, Aug\xe9 and de Rosnay released Justice's debut single, 'Waters of Nazareth'. During this time, they also established themselves as prolific remixers, reworking songs for artists including N.E.R.D., Britney Spears, Death from Above 1979, Fatboy Slim, Daft Punk, Franz Ferdinand, and Mr. Oizo. Justice's breakthrough arrived in 2007 with the release of 'D.A.N.C.E.' a catchy single with an attention-getting video that featured animated T-shirts. The duo's first album, \u2020 (aka Cross), appeared that June and incorporated samples from unexpected sources like the Italian prog rock outfit Goblin along with more typical dance music. The album's accolades included nominations for Best Dance Recording for 'D.A.N.C.E.' and Best Electronic/Dance Album for \u2020 at the 50th Grammy Awards. The live album and concert film A Cross the Universe appeared in 2008. The following year, Justice's remix of MGMT's 'Electric Feel' won a Grammy for Best Remixed Recording, Non Classical, and remixes of songs by U2 and Lenny Kravitz, as well as production work on the Birdy Nam Nam song 'The Parachute Ending' kept them busy in 2009. Aug\xe9 and de Rosnay returned in 2011 with their second album, Audio, Video, Disco, which was filled with prog rock sounds, guitars, and plenty of new wave-era influences. They toured extensively, with their second live album, Access All Arenas, released in 2013. Three years later, Justice returned with a pair of singles (July's 'Safe and Sound' and September's 'Randy') that arrived ahead of the full-length Woman that November. Described by Aug\xe9 and de Rosnay as their most joyful music yet, the album featured the London Contemporary Orchestra as well as vocalists including Morgan Phalen, Romuald, and Zoot Woman's Johnny Blake. While adapting their songs to tour in support of the album, Justice liked the reworked versions so much that they recorded them in the studio. The results were Woman Worldwide, which Ed Banger and Because Music issued in August 2018.",picture:"http://projectrevolver.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/JUSTICE.jpg",releases:"https://www.beatport.com/artist/justice/2331/releases"},{id:42,name:"MARC ROMBOY",genre:"Minimal Techno",nationality:"Germany",about:"German DJ and producer Marc Romboy is a veteran of the dance music scene, having founded several labels and released countless recordings since the early '90s. His emotional, groove-heavy tracks reflect a wide array of influences, not least Chicago house and '80s new wave, but classical and jazz as well. He co-founded the successful dance label Alphabet City in 1992, and achieved chart success during the '90s and early 2000s as part of trance duo Marc et Claude, whose 2000 single 'I Need Your Lovin' (Like the Sunshine)' nearly hit the Top 10 in the U.K. In 2004, he founded tech-house label Systematic, and his debut full-length, Gemini, appeared in 2006. He collaborated extensively with producer Stephan Bodzin as well as Detroit techno pioneer Blake Baxter, among many other artists, and continued releasing singles, albums, and mix CDs at a prodigious rate throughout the 2000s and 2010s. Romboy partially moved away from club music during the latter decade, exploring his classical influences on albums such as 2017's Reconstructing Debussy, a collaboration with the Dortmunder Philharmoniker. Born in M\xf6nchengladbach, Germany, Romboy began producing techno and trance tracks during the early '90s, regularly working with producers such as J\xfcrgen Driessen, Klaus Derichs, and Stefan Bossems. Romboy and Derichs founded Alphabet City in 1992, with several related imprints appearing afterwards, including Le Petit Prince. They began releasing music as Marc et Claude in 1993. While the duo's more experimental early releases verged on gabber and acid techno, they switched to a more accessible trance sound around 1997, subsequently scoring several Top 40 hits in the U.K. during the genre's commercial peak. They first hit the chart with 1997's 'La' before making their biggest impact with 'I Need Your Lovin' (Like the Sunshine)' a 2000 single which sampled the Korgis' hit 'Everybody's Got to Learn Sometime' and reached number 12. They reached the British Top 40 two more times; surprisingly, though they scored a few minor hits in their home country, none of them reached the Top 40. The duo founded the eponymous Marc et Claude's label during the late '90s and released their only full-length, You Own the Sound, in 2002. During the years Marc et Claude were active, Romboy continued to release more underground material as part of several additional projects, most of which were short-lived. He also released collaborations with legendary techno/ambient producers Pete Namlook and Thomas P. Heckmann in 1999. By the time Marc et Claude wound down in 2005, Romboy had largely moved away from trance, making more stripped-down tracks influenced by house, techno, disco, and electro. He launched Systematic in 2004; its first release was 'Every Day in My Life' a collaboration with Booka Shade. Romboy's solo single 'My Love Is Systematic' soon followed. 2005 brought collaborations with Blake Baxter, Paris the Black Fu (of Detroit Grand Pubahs), and Matthias Tanzmann, as well as the first of many co-productions with Stephan Bodzin. Systematic Sessions, Vol. 1, a double-CD mix split with Martin Landsky, appeared in 2005; its 2006 follow-up contained mixes by Romboy and Tommie Sunshine. Also in 2006, Romboy released his debut album, Gemini, which featured appearances from Baxter and Sunshine as well as revered Chicago house vocalist Robert Owens. Following singles with Gui Boratto and Chelonis R. Jones, as well as further mix CDs for Scandium Records and Mantra Vibes, Romboy released his second full-length, the slightly dark electro-house effort Contrast, in 2008. Mix CD Systematic Colours, Vol. 2 appeared in 2009. In 2011, Romboy and Bodzin released Luna, an extensive anthology of their work together. Romboy and Japanese techno innovator Ken Ishii paired up for the full-length Taiyo, which was issued in 2013. The following year, Romboy released Shades, a triple-CD collection which rounded up collaborations, remixes, and previously unreleased material. While Romboy continued releasing club singles, he ventured into downtempo and modern classical with two releases in 2017, both on his Hyperharmonic imprint. Voyage de la Plan\xe8te was a futuristic journey partially inspired by Jules Verne, while Reconstructing Debussy consisted of Romboy's interpretations of works by the French composer Claude Debussy, performed live with the Dortmunder Philharmoniker. In 2018, Romboy released singles on Kompakt (Speicher 103) and Bedrock Records ('Cosmo'), as well as two EPs with Petar Dundov (Caper Tran and Dimension D).",picture:"https://www.juno.co.uk/reviews/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/MARCROMBOY535.jpg",releases:"https://www.beatport.com/artist/marc-romboy/4898/releases"},{id:43,name:"BONOBO",genre:"Electronica, Ambient, Trip-Hop",nationality:"UK",about:"With the experimental warmth of '60s French films and the pizzicato flavor of horizontal hip-hop, Simon Green's Bonobo project established the welcome niche of a pretension-free, post-party intellectual chillout upon the release of his full-length debut in 2000. Since then, his sound and scope have expanded dramatically, with his sophisticated compositions and arrangements incorporating live instrumentation and encompassing influences ranging from jazz, house, folk, and soul to African, Asian, and Middle Eastern styles of music. While Green often tours solo as a DJ, he established a live touring ensemble in 2004, performing highly orchestrated versions of his songs to immense audiences, including several sold-out headlining gigs as well as main stage performances at festivals such as Coachella and Glastonbury. An almost silent figure among Ibizian romanticists, Green began in Brighton, debuting in 1999 with a track on Tru Thoughts Recordings' When Shapes Join Together compilation. Though tempted by offers from Mute and XL after the official issue of the Scuba EP and the 'Terrapin' single, Green stuck with Tru Thoughts for the acclaimed debut LP Animal Magic (2000). Highlighted by downtempo dub, funk, and an equally likable use of sitars, Animal Magic was an obvious success and plans were quickly made for careful European support appearances. In 2002, Tru Thoughts issued One Offs: Remixes & B Sides, compiling tracks from various limited vinyl releases as well as Bonobo's remixes for artists such as Amon Tobin and Pilote. Having signed to Coldcut's Ninja Tune label in 2001, Bonobo worked diligently on his sophomore album, Dial 'M' for Monkey, which arrived in 2003. A tour to support the record followed and was documented on the 2005 EP Live Sessions, which featured a Four Tet remix of the previous album's single 'Pick Up'. Bonobo's first mix CD, It Came from the Sea, was released in 2005 as part of Ninja Tune's Solid Steel series. Days to Come, Bonobo's third album, appeared in 2006, and was markedly less electronic than his previous work, with much more of a jazz influence and spotlighting the slinky vocals of India-born vocalist Bajka, as well as one song featuring Ninja Tune artist Fink. BBC Radio 1 DJ Gilles Peterson's audience voted Days to Come Album of the Year, and media interest in Bonobo grew exponentially, with his tracks frequently being featured in films, television programs and commercials, and video games ever since. Black Sands A performance DVD, Live at Koko, appeared in 2009, followed by the release of single 'The Keeper' which introduced the world to the vocal talents of honey-voiced British soul singer Andreya Triana. The full-length Black Sands followed in 2010, featuring Triana on two more excellent singles, 'Eyesdown' and 'Stay the Same' the former of which was driven by a shuffling U.K. garage-style beat, updating Bonobo's sound for the post-dubstep era and introducing his sound to new audiences. Green produced Triana's debut full-length Lost Where I Belong, which Ninja Tune also released in 2010. Black Sands Remixed appeared in 2012, featuring reworks by Lapalux, FaltyDL, Machinedrum, and many others, as well as a couple of non-album tracks. The North Borders, Bonobo's fifth full-length album, arrived in 2013, featuring R&B singer Erykah Badu among its guests. The album was Bonobo's most well-received work to date, charting in the Top 30 of the U.K. album chart and kickstarting a wildly successful international tour. By the end of 2013, Green contributed to the LateNightTales mix series, which featured Bonobo's cover of Donovan's 'Get Thy Bearings'. The North Borders Tour: Live appeared on Ninja Tune in 2014, documenting the Bonobo live experience aurally as well as visually. During the same year, Bonobo released two EPs, Flashlight and Ten Tigers, which continued to explore his dancefloor-friendly side. Studio album Migration appeared in early 2017; the full-length featured guest appearances from Rhye, Nick Murphy (formerly known as Chet Faker), and Moroccan group Innov Gnawa.",picture:"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/01/10/12/bonobo-neil-krug-dsc01778.jpg?w968",releases:"https://www.beatport.com/artist/bonobo/9978/releases"},{id:44,name:"DAFT PUNK",genre:"Electroonica, Disco House",nationality:"France",about:"Even as they evolved from French house pioneers in the '90s to dance tastemakers in the 2000s to mainstream heroes in the 2010s, Daft Punk remained one of dance music's most influential and iconic acts. The combined talents of Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter, the Parisian duo quickly won acclaim for their unique blend of first-wave acid house and techno with pop, indie rock, and hip-hop. One of the pair's first projects together was Darling, an instrumental indie cover band; their current recording name derives from a review in U.K. music weekly Melody Maker of a compilation tape Darling were featured on, released by Krautrock revivalists Stereolab (their lo-fi D.I.Y. cover of a Beach Boys song was derided as 'daft punk'). Subsequently ditching the almost inevitable creative cul-de-sac of rock for the more appealing rush of the dancefloor, the pair released their debut single, 'The New Wave' in 1993 on the celebrated Soma label. Instantly hailed by the dance music press as the work of a new breed of house innovators, the single was followed by 'Da Funk' the band's first true hit (the record sold 30,000 copies worldwide and saw thorough rinsings by everyone from Kris Needs to the Chemical Brothers). Although the group had only released a trio of singles ('The New Wave' and 'Da Funk' as well as the 1996 limited pressing of 'Musique'), in early 1996 Daft Punk were the subject of a minor bidding war. The group eventually signed with Virgin, with its first long-player, Homework, appearing early the following year (a brief preview of the album, 'Musique' was also featured on the Virgin compilation Wipeout XL next to tracks from Photek, Future Sound of London, the Chemical Brothers, and Source Direct). As with the earlier singles, the group's sound is a brazen, dancefloor-oriented blend of progressive house, funk, electro, and techno, with sprinklings of hip-hop-styled breakbeats and excessive, crowd-firing samples similar to other anthemic dance-fusion acts such as the Chemical Brothers and Monkey Mafia. In addition to his role in Daft Punk, Bangalter operates the Roul\xe9 label and has recorded under his own name (the underground smash 'Trax on da Rocks') as well as Stardust (the huge club/commercial hit 'Music Sounds Better with You'). After four long years of fans eagerly awaiting a follow-up to their brilliant debut, Daft Punk finally issued Discovery in March 2001. The live record Alive 1997 followed at the end of the year, and a by-now predictable four-year wait preceded the release of Human After All in early 2005. One year later, Daft Punk released a compilation, Musique, Vol. 1: 1993-2005, and in 2007 their second live record, Alive 2007, arrived. The album and its single 'Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger' won Grammy Awards early in 2009; shortly after, it was announced that the duo would compose the soundtrack to Tron: Legacy, the sequel to the 1982 classic sci-fi film Tron. Daft Punk's music for the movie was released in November 2010, shortly before the film -- which featured the group in a cameo -- arrived in theaters. Early in 2013, Daft Punk announced that they planned to have a new album released by May of that year. That March, the duo announced the album's title, Random Access Memories, and also launched an extensive press campaign featuring snippets of the album's lead single, 'Get Lucky' and interviews with some of their collaborators (Nile Rodgers, Paul Williams, Giorgio Moroder, Panda Bear). The single was officially released in April, and Random Access Memories arrived in May. The album became one of Daft Punk's biggest successes, ultimately winning Grammy Awards for Best Dance/Electronica Album, Album of the Year, and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical. 'Get Lucky' earned Grammys for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Record of the Year. In 2014, the duo appeared on Pharrell's album G I R L and collaborated with Jay-Z on the song 'Computerized'. A 2015 documentary titled Daft Punk Unchained charted their history from the '90s into the 2010s, featuring interviews with Rodgers, Pharrell, and Kanye West, among others. The duo remained active, collaborating next with the Weeknd's Abel Tesfaye on a pair of songs from his 2016 album Starboy, including the number one hit title track.",picture:"https://3w8dlo2orf8y3crtc22sslbh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Webp.net-resizeimage-9.jpg",releases:"https://www.beatport.com/artist/daft-punk/3547/releases"},{id:45,name:"ARMEN MIRAN",genre:"Deep House, Ambient Dub Techno",nationality:"Armenia",about:"Armen Miran's love and passion for electronic music genres started at a very young age; spending the majority of his time at underground music scenes.

Erez Aizen's cheap background in obsessed bedroom computer tinkering had led him into and out of a number of crude dance efforts, and when a mutual friend suggested he should get together with Amit Duvdevani, a thrash metal fan who had just returned from an aborted career path in India, the two found enough in common to surreptitiously explore the rising psychedelic trends pouring out of the nation's clubs. The results -- 1999's The Gathering, which was heavily inspired by the surreal ambient dance of Simon Posford, X-Dream, and Transwave, and 2000's Classical Mushroom, an aggressively melodic trance LP that broke the European, Japanese, and American markets -- elevated Infected Mushroom to one of Israel's key trance production duos. The duo's third album, B.P. Empire, found them deviating a bit from their established psy-trance sound, experimenting with classical and Middle Eastern-influenced melodies and slower tempos. The 2003 double CD Converting Vegetarians took this genre experimentation further, designating one disc for more straightforward trance tracks and a second disc with tracks ranging from ambient and abstract electronic music to synth pop and downtempo. IM the Supervisor followed in 2004, and found the duo adding new production techniques and influences as well as an increased presence of vocals. The album was more accessible than previous efforts and became their most commercially successful release to date. Following IM the Supervisor, Infected Mushroom relocated to Los Angeles, and began working with guitarists Thomas Cunningham and Erez Netz. The duo was ranked number nine in DJMag's Top 100 DJs poll in 2007, confirming their status as the most popular psychedelic trance act in the world. Infected Mushroom's 2007 full-length, Vicious Delicious, expanded their stylistic range beyond electronic dance music, encompassing hip-hop, rock, and Latin music. The album featured more guest appearances than previous albums, including vocals by Gilberto Cerezo of Kinky and Canadian hip-hop group Swollen Members, as well as the increased presence of live instrumentation. Arriving in 2009, Legend of the Black Shawarma (released in North America by Paul Oakenfold's Perfecto label) took their rock/trance fusion sound even further, including collaborations with Korn's Jonathan Davis and Jane's Addiction's Perry Farrell, as well as Infected Mushroom's remix of the Doors' 'Riders on the Storm'. In late 2011, Steve Aoki signed Infected Mushroom to his Dim Mak label. The group's first release for Dim Mak was 2012's Army of Mushrooms, yet another stylistic expansion, featuring dubstep, electro-house, and drum'n'bass tracks, as well as a cover of Foo Fighters' 'The Pretender'. The group then undertook a massive North American tour dubbed 'The Unveiling' which featured an ambitious, overwhelming audio-visual setup. This was followed by another North American tour, 'FungusAmongUS' along with guests the M Machine. Infected Mushroom released a collaborative EP called Friends on Mushrooms, Vol. 1 in early 2013, followed by a second volume later in the year. The duo also produced a track on Lady Gaga's 2013 album, Artpop. Friends on Mushrooms, Vol. 3 appeared in 2014, and a full-length titled Friends on Mushrooms, containing tracks from the EPs as well as two new songs, was released in early 2015. Later that year, Infected Mushroom released Converting Vegetarians, Vol. 2, which found them revisiting the psy-trance sound of their earlier work.

At the age of 12, however, a friend introduced him to the world of DJ mixtapes and Tenaglia became fascinated with mixing techniques. He began hustling tapes on the street and, when he was old enough, hit the Manhattan club-scene with gusto. Coming of age in the late '70s introduced him to the club and DJ often cited as the best of all time, the Paradise Garage and Larry Levan. Tenaglia spent much time observing Levan, and began his own DJ career soon after. Though he moved to Miami in 1985 to escape a glut of New York DJs, he was back by 1990, right on the cusp of a new house renaissance led by producers like Masters at Work and Frankie Knuckles, and the output of Strictly Rhythm and Nervous Records. Tenaglia had begun producing in the mid-'80s during his spell in Miami (a single from his Deepstate project signed to Atlantic and he also worked with Murk's Ralph Falcon) so by the time of his return to New York, he was quite comfortable in the studio. Tenaglia productions began appearing on labels like Minimal, Sexy, Tribal and Strictly Rhythm; he really hit the mainstream with a 1993 remix of the Daou's 'Surrender Yourself' a house epic which pioneered the harder underground sound which stormed Manhattan clubland (and therefore, most of America's dance scene) during the mid-'90s. With friend Junior Vasquez, Tenaglia was the city's most popular DJ and his residency at Twilo became legendary as the home of the most emotional dance music being mixed anywhere. Cementing Danny Tenaglia's connection with Tribal Records America was the 1994 club hit 'Bottom Heavy',it also led to abundant remix work for Madonna, Michael Jackson, Pet Shop Boys, Grace Jones, Jamiroquai, New Order and Lisa Stansfield, among others. His debut album, 1995's Hard & Soul, did well and Tenaglia hosted several Tribal mix albums, including two volumes in the Mix This Pussy series plus Gag Me with a Tune. His second proper album Tourism was released in 1998. Global Underground: Athens and Back to Mine followed in 1999.",picture:"https://www.residentadvisor.net/photos/2013/us130705dannyt/spy94212.jpg",releases:"https://www.beatport.com/artist/danny-tenaglia/418/releases"},{id:49,name:"DEEP DISH",genre:"Progressive House",nationality:"Iran",about:"Initially pigeonholed as deep-house producers though their blueprint for house music sweeps across trance, techno, and sub-basement dub, the Iranian-American duo known as Deep Dish produced a multitude of club staples during the 1990s while harvesting a stellar series of productions for their labels (Deep Dish, Yoshitoshi, Fast Food, and Middle East) by members of the ever-growing Washington, D.C. dance community. While most of Dubfire and Sharam's productions have the epic, grandiose feeling that ties many a house track to its disco forebear, the duo's knack for tight programming and genre-blending has carried them above many of their dance-chart compatriots. Both Ali 'Dubfire' Shirazinia and Sharam Tayebi were born in Iran, though their paths first crossed at a 1991 dance event in Washington, D.C.; both were immersed in the local DJ scene and working part-time at retail jobs they hated. They set up Deep Dish Records in 1992 and debuted with the production 'A Feeling' by Moods. In 1993, an old schoolmate of Ali's named Brian Transeau recorded 'A Moment of Truth' and 'Relativity' for the label; both singles spread the Deep Dish message on dancefloors, and a link with Detroit producer Carl Craig (with whom they swapped mixes) helped the pair's street credibility. By 1994, Dubfire and Sharam were ruling as kings of the D.C. house scene, and had set up the sublabel Yoshitoshi for releases by like-minded compatriots Submarine, Satori, Alcatraz, and Hani. That same year, DJ legend Danny Tenaglia convinced Tribal UK Records to sign Deep Dish for its new Tribal America subsidiary, and the duo hit the dance charts with productions like 'High Frequency' and 'Casa de X' Deep Dish also made their full-length mix debut in 1995, taking charge of compilations for Tribal America (Penetrate Deeper) and Slip 'N' Slide (Undisputed). The 1995 single 'Hideaway' by De'lacy practically made Deep Dish's career on a commercial and mainstream-dance level; their remix stormed the pop charts and earned them boatloads of additional remix work for Michael Jackson, Tina Turner, Janet Jackson, Pet Shop Boys, Kristine W., Everything But the Girl, the Beloved and the Shamen -- Deep Dish even reworked Brian Transeau's collaboration with Tori Amos, 'Blue Skies' Dubfire and Sharam added to their mix-album r\xe9sum\xe9 with another Tribal America collection (1996's In House We Trust) plus one for Deconstruction (Cream Separates) one year later. Just when Deep Dish appeared to be content with releasing a mix album or two each year, the duo recorded their proper studio debut, Junk Science, in 1998. Resuming the schedule, Deep Dish released mix sets in consecutive years: Yoshiesque, Renaissance Ibiza, and a second Yoshiesque by 2001. The year 2001 also saw the duo earn their first Remixer of the Year Grammy nomination for their work on Madonna's 'Music' and Amber's 'Sexual (La Da Di)' A remix of Dido's 'Thank You' won them the Grammy a year later, the same year their Global Underground: Moscow mix CD won Dancestar USA's Best Compilation award. A third volume of Yoshiesque followed in 2003 along with three different editions of Global Underground: Toronto, one with the duo spinning together and one solo set each from Dubfire and Sharam. The pair eventually went their separate ways in order to pursue solo ventures, and would not regroup until over a decade later when they released the single 'Quincy' in March 2014. That same month, Deep Dish broadcast their first Essential Mix since 2008 on BBC Radio 1 with Pete Tong.",picture:"https://smileradio.net/sites/default/files/resize/editor/1-deep-dish-surprise-show-650-430_0-620x410.jpg",releases:"https://www.beatport.com/artist/deep-dish/13/releases"},{id:50,name:"BASEMENT JAXX",genre:"Garage House, Big Beat, Electronica",nationality:"UK",about:"From their '90s singles to the more ambitious projects they tackled in the decades to come, Basement Jaxx were one of the U.K.'s most respected -- and enjoyable -- progressive house acts. While virtually everything South London production duo Simon Ratcliffe and Felix Buxton released was rooted in house, they mutated several styles (R&B, U.K. garage, ragga, Latin jazz, ambient techno) with an unmatched restlessness. They constantly shuffled the deck, all the while collaborating with an endless array of vocalists both known (including Biz Markie, Siouxsie Sioux, and Yoko Ono) and unknown. Before they met (at a Thames riverboat party organized by Buxton), Ratcliffe grooved to the deep Latin funk of War and George Duke, while Buxton was turned on to Chicago house. Ratcliffe and Buxton formed Atlantic Jaxx Records in 1994 and were undoubtedly honored to count among fans of their first release none other than DJ legend and Basement Jaxx influence Tony Humphries, who played 'Da Underground' from the EP on his New York mix show consistently during 1994-1995. For their second release, the duo recruited vocalist Corrina Josephs, who later became practically a member of the team herself. The 1995 single 'Samba Magic' was picked up for distribution by Virgin, and in time, Basement Jaxx were drawing praise from all corners of the American and British house community as one of the top house production units. The pair spent much of 1996 working on remixes (for the Pet Shop Boys, Roger Sanchez, and Lil' Mo' Yin Yang, among others), then released a third Basement Jaxx EP. One track from the EP, 'Flylife' became a Top 20 hit in England after being re-released by Multiply in mid-1997, and the single proved one of the most popular anthems of the year on the worldwide club scene. Late that year, Ratcliffe and Buxton released a compilation of their most crucial Atlantic Jaxx sides. After being courted by several major labels, Basement Jaxx signed to the independent XL Recordings (also home to the Prodigy) and readied their debut full-length, Remedy, for a 1999 release. Second album Rooty followed two years later, an outgrowth of the duo's similarly named club night. Kish Kash followed in 2003 and featured the hit 'Good Luck' a collaboration with Lisa Kekaula that became the theme to BBC's Euro 2004 coverage. That year, the album won the first-ever Best Electronic/Dance Album award at the 47th Grammy Awards. The year 2005 saw the release of the aptly named The Singles collection, as well as a gig headlining the Pyramid Stage at that year's Glastonbury Festival when Kylie Minogue's cancer diagnosis forced her to cancel. The following year's sprawling Crazy Itch Radio featured collaborations with Robyn and Lily Allen. In 2008, Basement Jaxx contributed to the track 'Rocking Chair' on Cyndi Lauper's Bring Ya to the Brink, writing and producing the song; they also released the Planet EP series that year. On 2009's Scars, which featured cameos by Yoko Ono, Yo! Majesty, Lightspeed Champion, and Santigold, the duo returned to the leaner approach of the Remedy days, saving their more experimental material for the companion album Zephyr, which arrived late that year. Basement Jaxx vs. Metropole Orkest, which featured versions of the duo's previously released songs arranged for a 70-piece orchestra, arrived in 2011, along with the score to Joe Cornish's film Attack the Block, on which they collaborated with Stephen Price. That year, Buxton and Ratcliffe announced they were working on a new album, and over the next couple of years began previewing tracks from it during their live sets. They premiered the single 'Back 2 the Wild' on their YouTube channel in April 2013, with 'What a Difference Your Love Makes' and 'Unicorn' following soon after. The uplifting Junto -- which means 'together' in Spanish -- featured appearances by Mykki Blanco, DJ Sneak, and Shakka, and arrived in August 2014.",picture:"https://static.billboard.com/files/media/basement-jaxx-billboard-650-compressed.jpg",releases:"https://www.beatport.com/artist/basement-jaxx/6007/releases"},{id:51,name:"ARMAND VAN HELDEN",genre:"Garage House, Big Beat, Electronica",nationality:"USA",about:"Until he began branching out in 1996 with a barrage of album productions and remix classics (several of which were heard by more people than the originals), Armand Van Helden was one of the best-kept secrets in house music, recording for such labels as Strictly Rhythm, Henry St., and Logic. Afterwards, he became one of the top names in dance music altogether. As one in the steady progression of top in-house producers for Strictly Rhythm during the early '90s, Van Helden joined such names as Todd Terry, Erick Morillo, Roger Sanchez, Masters at Work, and George Morel to record scores of club hits. By the late '90s, a clutch of crucial remixes and several albums made Van Helden's name as one of the most popular producers around. His fame continued well into the 21st century, thanks to successful collaborations with Dizzee Rascal, Steve Aoki, and especially A-Trak, with whom he formed the chart-topping duo Duck Sauce in 2009. Van Helden spent time in Holland, Turkey, and Italy while growing up the son of an Air Force man, and listened to music from an early age. He bought a drum machine at the age of 13 and began DJ'ing two years later, mostly hip-hop and freestyle. Based in Boston while attending college, Van Helden proceeded to moonlight as a DJ; though he settled into a legal-review job after graduation, he quit in 1991 to begin working on production for the remix service X-Mix Productions (founded by his future manager, Neil Petricone). Van Helden also owned a residency at Boston's Loft, and soon made it into one of the most popular nightclubs in the city. After playing one of his production demos for the dance A&R guru Gladys Pizarro in 1992, Van Helden released his proper debut single, Deep Creed's 'Stay on My Mind' for Nervous Records. Later that year, Van Helden released 'Move It to the Left' by Sultans of Swing, his first single for the premiere American dance label Strictly Rhythm. Though a moderate club hit, the single was eclipsed by another Strictly Rhythm offering, 1994's 'Witch Doktor'. It became a dancefloor hit around the world and introduced him to a larger club audience. Although he had remixed Deee-Lite, Jimmy Somerville, New Order, Deep Forest, and Faithless, a reworked version of Tori Amos' 'Professional Widow' hit the clubs with the same impact as his 'Witchdoktor' single. During 1996-1997, Van Helden became the name for forward-thinking pop and dance artists to recruit for remix duty from the Rolling Stones, Janet Jackson, and Puff Daddy to Sneaker Pimps, C.J. Bolland, and Daft Punk. His own-name singles productions continued unabated, with hits like 'Cha Cha' and 'The Funk Phenomena' plus the release of his first album, Old School Junkies. Following a 1997 Greatest Hits retrospective, Van Helden returned to his old-school rap roots with the party breakbeat album, Sampleslayer...Enter the Meatmarket. The 2 Future 4 U album followed in 1998, spawning a U.K. number one single in 'U Don't Know Me' (featuring Duane Harden) as well as the Top 20 follow-up 'Flowerz'. In mid-2000, Van Helden returned with Killing Puritans, which contained the hit 'Koochy' built around a sample of Gary Numan's iconic 'Cars'. Gandhi Khan followed in 2001, and New York: A Mix Odyssey appeared in 2004, containing hit collaborations with Spalding Rockwell 'Hear My Name' and Tara McDonald 'My My My'. Both of these songs also appeared on Van Helden's 2005 studio album Nympho, and 'My My My' became a chart hit once again when it was re-released and remixed in 2006. Van Helden's Ghettoblaster album, influenced by freestyle and other '80s dance sounds, appeared in 2007. Retrospective You Don't Know Me: The Best of Armand Van Helden and New York: A Mix Odyssey, Pt. 2 both appeared in 2008. In 2009, Van Helden collaborated with British rapper Dizzee Rascal for a fidget-house song called 'Bonkers'. The song hit number one in the U.K., and was a decent-sized hit elsewhere. Later in the year, he teamed up with Canadian DJ A-Trak under the name Duck Sauce, producing a track called 'aNYway'. It hit the charts in a few countries, but it was a moderate success compared to next year's 'Barbra Streisand'. Built around an infectious Boney M sample, the song hit number one in several countries, partially thanks to the viral popularity of its music video, which featured cameos by Pharrell Williams, Kanye West, Andr\xe9 3000, and numerous other famous musicians. A few other Duck Sauce singles followed during the next few years, leading up to full-length Quack, which finally arrived in 2014. Van Helden continued to be an in-demand remixer, with stars such as Sam Smith, Madonna, and Disclosure among his clients. In 2015, he released a three-CD mix on Ministry of Sound titled Masterpiece, including one disc of early house tracks, one disc dedicated to yacht rock, and another consisting of '80s freestyle. Van Helden's recording career was given another retrospective in 2016, with Defected Presents House Masters.",picture:"https://www.electrowow.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/armand-van-helden-remix.jpg",releases:"https://www.beatport.com/artist/armand-van-helden/270/releases"},{id:52,name:"FAITHLESS",genre:"Big Beat, Electronica, Progressive House",nationality:"UK",about:"A prime house-pop group and consistent club act, Faithless is at its core a duo of producers Rollo and Sister Bliss. Before the group officially came together in 1995, Rollo had produced a club hit 'Don't You Want Me' as Felix in 1992', plus an album for Kristine W. and remixes for the Pet Shop Boys, Bj\xf6rk, and Simply Red. Sister Bliss, a piano and violin prodigy from the age of five, converted to acid house in 1987, and quickly became one of the U.K.'s best house DJs, also recording several singles as herself. Though the two had begun producing together as early as 1993, Faithless became a stable quartet two years later with the addition of vocalists Jamie Catto (previously in the Big Truth Band) and Maxi Jazz (from the Soul Food Cafe Band). Faithless reached worldwide status quickly, with the 1994 singles 'Salva Mea' (one of the biggest dance hits of the year), 'Insomnia' and 'Reverence'. The debut Faithless album, also titled Reverence, appeared in late 1996 on Rollo's Cheeky Records, and was picked up for distribution by Arista the next year. Sunday 8pm followed in 1998, reaching number ten in Britain and lofting several of its club hits into the pop charts, including 'Bring My Family Back', 'Take the Long Way Home' and the Top Ten 'God Is a DJ'. (It was reissued the following year with a collection of remixes titled Saturday 3am.) A comedown mix album, Back to Mine, appeared in early 2001, just before Faithless released Outrospective, album number three, in June. Sparked by a pair of British hits, 'We Come 1' and 'One Step Too Far' (the latter featuring Dido on vocals), Outrospective charted across Europe and was certified platinum. In 2004, the band released the quieter than usual No Roots, with a new member (LSK) adding vocals. Two years later Faithless returned with 2006's To All New Arrivals. Featuring guest vocals from Robert Smith and Cat Power, the album failed to make the British Top Ten unlike their previous album. The Dance saw Faithless make a comeback in 2010, but even with a high-profile show at that year's Glastonbury Festival, the album became their last. In 2011, Maxi Jazz announced via their website that the band would come to an end. Faithless played their final live dates at London's Brixton Academy in April 2011. Within just a few years, however, the band made a comeback, playing several open-air venues during the summer of 2015 and releasing a remix album, Faithless 2.0, in September. The album included reworkings by a host of the biggest names in dance music, including Avicii, Ti\xebsto, Rudimental, Armin Van Buuren, Eric Prydz, Above & Beyond, and Booka Shade. It also included several new originals from the band.",picture:"https://djmag.com/sites/default/files/styles/djmag_landscape/public/article/image/FAITHLESS_0.jpg?itok=CXQNkVhX",releases:"https://www.beatport.com/artist/faithless/18450/releases"},{id:53,name:"UNDERWORLD",genre:"Big Beat, Electronica, Techno",nationality:"UK",about:"Underworld became one of the most crucial electronic acts of the 1990s with a progressive synthesis of old and new, an approach that has served them well through the late 2010s. The trio's two-man front line, vocalist Karl Hyde and keyboard player Rick Smith, have been recording together since the early-'80s new wave explosion. After the pair released a pair of obscure rock albums, they hit it big the following decade with new recruit Darren Emerson. The roots of Underworld go back to the dawn of the 1980s, when Hyde and Smith formed a new wave band called Freur. The group released Doot-Doot in 1983 and Get Us Out of Here two years later, but subsequently disintegrated. Hyde worked on guitar sessions for Debbie Harry and Prince, then reunited with Smith in 1988 to form an industrial-funk band called Underworld. The pair earned an American contract with Sire and released Underneath the Radar (1988) and Change the Weather (1989). Each album produced a single that reached the back half of the Billboard Hot 100, but Underworld disappeared shortly thereafter. Underworld treated techno as the dominant force. Their debut album, Dubnobasswithmyheadman, was praised by many critics upon release later in 1993 and crossed over to the British pop chart, peaking at number 12. Hyde, Smith, and Emerson impressed many at their concert dates as well. The trio apparently relished playing live, touring Great Britain twice plus Japan, Europe, and the annual summer festival circuit, where their Glastonbury appearance became the stuff of legend. Dubnobasswithmyheadman was released in the U.S. in 1995 after being licensed to TVT Records. During the rest of the year, Underworld were relatively quiet, releasing only the single 'Born Slippy'. Finally, Second Toughest in the Infants appeared in early 1996 to much critical praise. The trio gained no small amount of commercial success later in the year when 'Born Slippy' (specifically its B-side version, 'Born Slippy .NUXX') was featured on the soundtrack to Trainspotting, the controversial Scottish film that earned praise from critics all over the globe. In the U.K., Second Toughest peaked at number nine during a 34-week stay on the album chart. Underworld also remained busy with Tomato -- their own graphic design company responsible for commercials from such high-profile clients as Nike, Sony, Adidas, and Pepsi -- and remixing work for Depeche Mode, Bj\xf6rk, St. Etienne, Sven V\xe4th, Simply Red, and Leftfield. Emerson continued to DJ on a regular basis, releasing mix albums for Mixmag! and Deconstruction. Underworld's 1999 LP, Beaucoup Fish, entered the U.K. chart at number three. The band continued to tour the world, as documented in 2000 with the live album Everything, Everything, after which Emerson left to continue his DJ career. A Hundred Days Off, Underworld's first LP as a duo since 1989, was released in mid-2002. One year later, the stopgap compilation 1992-2002 appeared. By 2005, the duo had officially been joined by one of Britain's most respected DJs, Darren Price (although he contributed to A Hundred Days Off), and his work also appeared on a series of online-only EPs Underworld released during 2005 and 2006. They also recorded new material for the soundtrack of the Anthony Minghella film Breaking and Entering. Their first 'proper' full-length since 2002, Oblivion with Bells, appeared in 2007. It was followed in 2010 by Barking, an album that featured numerous guest producers including Paul van Dyk, Appleblim, and High Contrast. Underworld simultaneously released two more compilations, the triple-CD 1992\u20132012 as well as the single-disc A Collection (which featured previously unreleased collaborations with Brian Eno, Ti\xebsto, and Mark Knight & D. Ramirez), in late 2011. In 2012, Underworld served as music directors for the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics, held in London. They wrote two songs ('And I Will Kiss' and 'Caliban's Dream') for the opening ceremony, and 11 of their tracks were included on the ceremony's official soundtrack album, Isles of Wonder. Underworld were granted the prize for Innovation in Sound at the 2012 Q Awards. In 2013, Karl Hyde released his debut solo album, Edgeland. The following year, he issued a collaborative album with Brian Eno, Someday World; the full-length was quickly followed by High Life, an excellent album that recalled Eno's pioneering work with Talking Heads and David Byrne during the '70s and '80s. Underworld announced plans to reissue their studio albums in remastered and expanded editions. A 20th anniversary edition of Dubnobasswithmyheadman appeared in 2014, available as a double CD as well as a super deluxe five-CD version, loaded with remixes and unreleased recordings. This was followed by a similar reissue of Second Toughest in November of 2015 (a bit short of its actual 20th anniversary), again as a two-disc edition, as well as an expansive four-CD configuration, including an entire disc devoted to charting the evolution of 'Born Slippy .NUXX' from studio demos and live incarnations to an iconic, era-defining anthem. In 2016, they returned with new music and a new label as Caroline International issued Barbara Barbara, We Face a Shining Future. The album became their third Top Ten U.K. hit and was nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Dance/Electronic Album. After a pair of non-album singles, Underworld worked with Iggy Pop on Teatime Dub Encounters, a five-track EP issued in 2018.",picture:"https://www.irishnews.com/picturesarchive/irishnews/irishnews/2018/05/23/190311794-89d8ebe2-cd57-4807-aac5-9c55b7c6cc81.jpg",releases:"https://www.beatport.com/artist/underworld/4417/releases"},{id:54,name:"DAVE PAD",genre:"Deep House",nationality:"Russia",about:"Based On A True Story!",picture:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/us0x7KYNQ04/maxresdefault.jpg",releases:"https://www.beatport.com/artist/dave-pad/197054/releases"},{id:55,name:"MARK ALOW",genre:"Deep House",nationality:"Spain",about:"Spanish producer Mark Alow is an emerging talent with an ear for deep grooves and organic melodies.
